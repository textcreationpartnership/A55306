            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the CHRISTIAN Reader.</head>
            <p>HE that with ſerious eyes looks on that dreadful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, lapſed Angels lying in Chains of Darkneſs for ever, and that for one Sin, may very well ſtand and wonder at the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men; in which worms are as it were Angelized, and little lumps of corrupted duſt are firſt refined by Grace, and then transfigured into Glory. The pure Origine of this great Work is no other than the Divine Grace and Love, which have ſo fairly pourtraied and limmed out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:63874:3"/>upon every piece of it, that all the Saints above and below may read the Characters thereof; and have reaſon to cry out, Grace, Grace. Indeed Heaven and Earth too ſhould ring with the Praiſes of it, and Eternity it ſelf will be ſhort enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and admire it in. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this Glorious deſign the Son of God left his Fathers Boſom, and appeared in our Fleſh, to make a Robe for us of his own Righteouſneſs, and a Laver for us in his own Blood. Our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him is now in Heaven, and his Spirit is deſcended to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Image on us, thereby to make us meet for that Bleſſed Region, to ſecure all to us. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath let down a great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the precious Goſpel, in which we have a Map of Glory,
<pb facs="tcp:63874:3"/>and Eternal Life ſet before us; to elevate our Souls, which are ſparks of Immortality, out of the duſt and rubbiſh of the Fall, and to ſet them aſpiring after the true Pleaſures and Beatitudes which are above. That we may not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake our way, or faint in it, the holy Spirit hath in the Goſpel drawn many lines of Holineſs and Comfort: There are pure Precepts to chalk out the Way to Heaven, and ſweet Promiſes to cordial us therein; and to give us ſome Taſtes of Heaven before we come there. The great condition of this Salvation which ſtreams down out of the fountain of Grace through the Blood of Chriſt into the Evangelical Promiſes, is no other than Faith. This is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora</hi> of Glory, Heaven and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life dawn in it; This is the
<pb facs="tcp:63874:4"/>
               <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of Things hoped for. It preſentiates the Celeſtial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and in ſome ſort ſets the Believer by the rivers of Pleaſures which are there: This receives all from Grace, and aſcribes all to it, prompting the Believer to confeſs touching his Spiritual Being and Working, By the Grace of God I am what I am, and by the Grace of God I do what I do. This u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites to Chriſt, wraps up it ſelf in his Righteouſneſs, feaſts on his precious Body and Blood unto Life Eternal, and ſurrenders up Heart and Life to the bleſſed duct of his Spirit and Word. Walking on in holy Precepts it drinks Comfort out of Promiſes, following hard after Holineſs it meets with Peace, ſuch as paſſes underſtanding; overcoming earth with all its Troops of vanity, it
<pb facs="tcp:63874:4"/>aſcends and takes Heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and renting off the dark veil of Time, it looks into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and aſpires after that Bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making Viſion, which is the true Center of it. Where this Grace is, there the Goſpel is not in word only, but in power: The Truth ſtands not meerly without in the letter, but is entertained within, and ſprings up in the Heart as a ſeed of Immortal Happineſs. The Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of this noble Grace have drawn out my Thoughts in the enſuing Diſcourſe now offered to publick view. The Errata's and Infirmities in it beg the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders kind Indulgence: And the holy Truths therein call for a Practical Improvement. If but any Mite may get into the Treaſury, if any thing thereby
<pb facs="tcp:63874:5"/>may redound to the Glory of God, or profit of Men, it is enough; and a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for him, who is</p>

                  <p>Some general acceptions of the word <hi>Faith</hi> in Scripture, premiſed. Precious Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and conſidered in the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, as it is a grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE word <hi>[Faith]</hi> hath many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in Scripture, among which I ſhall touch upon ſome.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it imports the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> or object of Faith; thus St. <hi>Paul preached the faith, Gal.</hi> 1.23. that is, the Goſpel, which is worthy to be ſo called, becauſe it is the great Engine, which lets down Gods faith to men, and catches up mens faith to God.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63874:6"/>
               <p>Sometimes it imports a dogmatical or hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith, which is an aſſent to the word of God as true and infallible: thus the very devils <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a God,</hi> and (which is more then many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worms do) <hi>they tremble, Jam.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it imports a temporary Faith, which is but a dogmatical faith, budding and bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome taſts and joys in the things of God: thus <hi>the ſtony ground received the word with joy, Mat.</hi> 13.20.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it imports a miraculous Faith, which by a ſpecial inſtinct gives ſuch a touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power of God, as to produce wonderful effects in nature; <hi>a grain of this is enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move mountains, Mat.</hi> 17.20.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it imports ſaving Faith, called by the Apoſtle <hi>precious Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Omitting the reſt, I ſhall fix my Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, and that upon a double account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> This precious faith virtually includes the reſt. In Faith in the firſt notion, there is only the Goſpel or object ſtanding alone by it ſelf, but in this faith the act and the object are in ſweet conjunction; the ſoul is <hi>Goſpellized,</hi> and the Goſpel, which outwardly runs in the letter, is inwardly glorified in the believers heart. In dogmatical faith there is an aſſent to the truths of God, and ſo there is in precious faith, but in a more eminent manner; the firſt embracing the Goſpel only in its naked truth, and hiſtory is but a dead and a cold notion, but the ſecond embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſame in its goodneſs and ſpiritual myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, carries life and warmth in it: temporary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63874:6"/>faith hath ſome joys in the things of God, but precious faith hath the ſame in a more excellent way; the former is but a flaſh and away, <hi>a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without a root,</hi> the Goſpel is not radicated in him, but lies as it were upon the ſurface of his heart: Jeſus Chriſt is not entirely received by him, but by parcels only; hence a little ſtorm of perſecution blows off all the bloſſoms of his joy, but the latter is a thing of a higher excellency and permanency. In the true believer the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is intimately rooted, and Chriſt impartially received, even croſs and all: Hence <hi>ſuch an one can joy in tribultions, and under afflictions wait for conſolations.</hi> Miraculous faith can work wonders, and ſo can precious too: the firſt works wonders in the body of nature, by a touch upon Almighty power, and the ſecond works won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the ſouls of men, by a touch upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty grace. A grain of this can remove ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mountains, mountains of guiltineſs off from the Conſcience, mountains of hardneſs off from the Will, and mountains of earthineſs off from the Affections: outward miracles in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches infancy followed believers for a while, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. but inward miracles are ever found in them; and no wonder, for <hi>the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of Gods power is unto them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Eph.</hi> 1.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This precious faith doth compleat the nobleſt inſtinct in man; I mean, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pulſe which he hath after happineſs. All men would be happy, but none ever hit upon it till faith came. The Pagans by natural light
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63874:7"/>have ſome knowledge of God, the ſupream good, but the only acceſs to him is by faith. The Philoſophers, whoſe profeſſion was the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of wiſdom, and whoſe lamp of reaſon burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brighter then others, were no better then the blind <hi>Sodomites,</hi> unable to find the door of happineſs.<note place="margin">De civitat. Dei. l. <hi>19.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> Hence, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> relates out of <hi>Varro,</hi> the Philoſophers might be divided into two hundred eighty eight Sects about the chief good, which faith can indubitably immediately point at. Some Philoſophers placed mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in pleaſures, which yet are but <hi>the ſad transformations of men into bruits.</hi> Some in honours, which yet are but <hi>great ſervitudes,</hi> which made the Noble <hi>Charles the fift</hi> weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Son, upon whoſe ſhoulders, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire out of the world, he left the burden of a Crown. Some in riches, which yet are but <hi>thorns choaking that precious ſeed of the word,</hi> which would grow up (if embraced) into life eternal. Others, which were better marks-men, in moral virtues, yet even theſe (as a learned man obſerves) are but <hi>circa res humanas,</hi> their ſphear is but humane converſe; and they do not (as faith) elevate the ſoul into a conjunction with God, which is the only true happineſs. When the Apoſtle in his Catalogue of graces (which miniſter an entrance into the everlaſting kingdom) puts in <hi>temperance</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. he ſpeaks of them as Graces, not as meer moral virtues, but as Chriſtianized by Faith, which in that place is ſet in the van. But waving the Pagan world, let us come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63874:7"/>the Chriſtian. There the way of life is clearly manifeſted; yet none, void of faith, ever trod a right ſtep in it, nay, nor ſpiritually diſcerned it, <hi>unto them that are without all things are in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, Mark</hi> 4.11. to the unbeliever, though never ſo great a Scholar, Chriſt and grace and heaven are but as it were in parables. The <hi>Kohathites</hi> (whoſe name, as a learned man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is derived from ſtupidity) carried the holy things covered, and ſo do all the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Rabbies in the Church, till faith waken them out of the ſtupor of the fall: they diſcern not ſpiritually the beatitude objectively expoſed to view in the Goſpel, till faith draw off the vail from their hearts, but as ſoon as that is done, the way into the holy of Holies is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and paſſable, and ſo the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> inſtinct af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happineſs receives a compleature. Now this precious faith, being precious in the leaſt minim of it, may be conſidered either in its firſt and loweſt meaſure, or in its fruits and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous progreſſes. In its firſt and loweſt meaſure, it is the very condition of the Goſpel, and puts a man by virtue thereof into a ſtate of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whoſoever believeth, even with the leaſt degree of precious faith, ſhall be ſaved.

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> This precious faith is a thing above the natural faculty of man. There is in man a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faith or believing faculty, and the very Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſophers would call for it from their Scholars; but as it is in the fall of a houſe, not this or that beam falls, but all comes down at once: ſo it was in the fall of man, not this or that natural faculty fell, but all together, and among the reſt, the believing faculty fell alſo: hence as it lyes in the duſt and rubbiſh of the fall, it centers in the creature, and without the elevation of grace, it can in no wiſe lift up it ſelf to God and Chriſt. <hi>We are begotten again to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Obſerve, there muſt be a touch from Chriſt in glory, or elſe there will be no elevation; Chriſt muſt firſt apprehend us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. or elſe our believing faculty is but as a dead hand, unable to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This precious faith is a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove moral virtue. There is a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt difference
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63874:9"/>between moral virtues and ſpiritual graces: the ſeeds of moral virtues are found in lapſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of ſpiritual graces there are none at all in it, nothing but a naked capacity. Moral virtues do from thoſe natural ſeeds bud and ſpring forth into being under the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſpirit, but ſpiritual graces, not being ſeeded in nature, are meer infuſions or creations; the ſeed of God muſt drop down from heaven into the heart, or elſe theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt: hence the Apoſtle in contradiſtinction to the virtues of men calls them <hi>the virtues of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. ſuch a thing is faith, of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler extraction then all the moral virtues in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This precious Faith advances both our natural faculties and our moral virtues. It advances our natural faculties, and ſo ſhews it ſelf what it is: grace is nature elevated above it ſelf, a reaſon with an heavenly light in it, a will with an holy law in it, and affections as it were upon the wings of Angels, ſoaring into the upper world. After ſuch ſort doth faith elevate the humane faculties: when faith comes, God ſhines into the heart, and then the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which before had a cloud on it, ſparkles out as a pearl in the Sun-beams; the day-ſtar is up in the heart and whileſt others live by candlelight, the believer hath the Sun; then the will which lay in its luſts as a ſlave in its chains, is ſet upon the wheel and made <hi>free indeed;</hi> then the affections, which converſed among the tombs of the creatures, are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63874:9"/>here, but <hi>are riſen with Chriſt to ſeek the things above.</hi> Moreover it advances moral virtues alſo, it grafts them upon a nobler ſtock, they are no longer meer bloſſoms of reaſon, but fruits of the ſpirit. <hi>Joſephus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the patience of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> under the torments of the bloody <hi>Antiochus,</hi> cryes up, <hi>Reaſon, Reaſon,</hi> as if that were the rock upon which they ſtood; but ſure, he ſpeaks below them, a greater then reaſon was there, even faith, as the Apoſtle aſſerts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. a higher ſpirit then their own acted in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and elevated it above meer morality. Again, meer moral virtues, iſſuing meerly out of our own reaſon, are apt to breed a moth of pride and vain ſelf-reflection: here we find the Moraliſt crowing after a ſtrange rate, <hi>Beatae vitae cauſa &amp; firmamentum eſt, ſibi ſidere, turpe eſt Deos fatigare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sence. Epiſt. <hi>31.</hi>

                  <hi>quid votis apus eſt? fac te felicem, exurge &amp; te dignum ſinge Deo,</hi> as if he would have no other happineſs but what was of his own making; but when Faith comes, off go the plumes of pride, and humility is as a vail over all the moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. I live in temperance and juſtice (ſaith the believing Moraliſt) <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Add hereunto meer moral virtues in their intention, riſe no higher then their own level of humanity; but when faith comes, there is a pearl in the head, a pure intention in each of them towards the glory of God: he that before was temperate to himſelf, juſt to others, and patient to neceſſity, is now all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63874:10"/>theſe to God; <hi>Feci Deo,</hi> is the Motto of every moral act. To conclude, what ſweet and ſtrong motives Faith adds unto moral virtues, may appear in the famous inſtance of <hi>Juſtus Lipſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Melch. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. Vit.

                  <p>Of the ſpecial nature of Faith, and here of <hi>Spiritual Illumination,</hi> the firſt ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient therein. What it is, with the neceſſity thereof unto Faith, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE next thing is to conſider Faith in its ſpecial nature; and here the firſt thing in order, is <hi>ſupernatural illumination:</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I ſhall firſt ſhew what that is, and then demonſtrate the neceſſity of it to Faith. And firſt, what it is, <hi>it is God ſhining into the heart, and lighting our candle, to make us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern divine things in a ſpiritual way.</hi> It is an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination above nature ſubjectively, and not objectively only; it is a thing above reaſon and all its improvements made upon external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; reaſon may be taken in a double poſture, either ſitting with the glaſs of the creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and ſo it is meerly the light of nature, or elſe ſitting with the glaſs of the Scriptures before it, and ſo it is a notional knowledge of Divinity; but this ſupernatural light is above reaſon in both theſe poſtures: Firſt, take rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the creature-glaſs before it, and this ſupernatural light is much above it. And here I might ſhew, how much the Scripture-glaſs excells that of the creature: the divine words
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63874:11"/>there out-ſhine the Sun, out-weigh the earth, out-vye all the treaſures, and out-reliſh all the ſweetneſſes in nature. God is more glorious in the Scripture-robes, then in all the viſible world: his chariot in the word is ſtatelier then that in the clouds. Evangelical light is a richer garment upon him then meer natural; in the creature there is but a print or footſtep of God, but in the Scripture there is his very image and reſemblance. Alſo, which is a conſequent on the former, this ſupernatural light, having the purer glaſs, is of a far greater latitude then meer reaſon: it ſpreads it ſelf into many myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which never entred into natural reaſon, but were hid from ages in the divine mind, it takes a view of thoſe rare Evangelical pearls which were never digged out of reaſons mine, but dropt down from heaven unto the ſons of men: But, becauſe the compariſon of theſe two lights as to their outward glaſſes and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes is not ſo pertinent, I ſhall compare them as to their inward natures, and only in ſuch things as both of them extend unto, and a vaſt difference will appear between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Reaſon is a far lower light then that of Faith: in natural light Reaſon is the very facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in ſupernatural it is but a capacity: God muſt ſhine into the heart, there muſt be light upon light, ſupernatural upon natural, or elſe there is no faith. <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>open or</hi> (as the original hath it) <hi>reveal thou mine eyes, Pſal.</hi> 119.18. There is in faith, a revelation of eyes, and not of objects only; the Apoſtle ſpeaks
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63874:11"/>of <hi>being renewed in the very ſpirit of the mind, Eph.</hi> 4.23. the rational ſpirit is <hi>the candle of the Lord,</hi> but unleſs it be new lighted, it is too dim ſince the fall to believe the things of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reaſon is a far weaker light then that of Faith. It is a light ſhining in darkneſs, and after all its glimmerings, it leaves but <hi>a fooliſh heart and vain imaginations, Rom.</hi> 1.21. it is as a little ſpark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> an ocean of reigning corruptions, and theſe keep the heart from taking fire with the love of thoſe excellencies which are known by nature. <hi>The Gentiles knew God, but they did not like to have him in their knowledge, Rom.</hi> 1.28. millions of unruly luſts, like the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> about <hi>Lots</hi> houſe, beſet this natural light, and keep it as it were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; thus the Apoſtle, <hi>they withheld it in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 1.18. and it is too weak to break out of this priſon, and ſhew it ſelf pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically: I ſhall give ſome inſtances hereof. All Nations in all climates and through all ages, have conſpired together to confeſs a Deity: Conſcience within bears witneſs to him, and ſo do all the creatures without alſo; one would wonder therefore that ever Idolatry ſhould get footing in the world, but what ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they changed the truth of God into a lye, and the glory of the incorruptible one into a corruptible image, Rom.</hi> 1.23.25. there were ſtore of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable idols among them; no doubt natural light gave its ſecret vote for God, but it was but the vote of a poor priſoner altogether inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63874:12"/>it was not ſtrong enough to make them own God in his own world. Again, reaſon and nature ſay, that God muſt be worſhipped with the heart, and that a pure heart, <hi>purâ mente colendus,</hi> was the old verſe, <hi>in ſuo cui<expan>

Doth not nature and reaſon plead for all things of common honeſty and humanity, and yet in the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> which were of high renown, and commended even by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and which (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates) <hi>Lycurgus</hi> took ſingular pleaſure to ſee put in ure, even as God rejoyced to ſee the world move and turn about: I ſay in theſe there are ſuch obſcenities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities as would put any one to the bluſh to ſee them in ſtory; what elſe are the dancing of maids naked, and throwing weak children into a pit of water, ſpoken of by <hi>Plutarch?</hi> well might the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> have ſpared the Temple and Sacrifices to their Law-giver, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had been truer to the Law of Nature.

In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, whileſt this ſhined clear, there were no ſuch things as outward Idols or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, afterwards, upon the declenſion thereof, thoſe things crept in by degrees, firſt into ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and then into Churches, and there, firſt for inſtruction only, and afterwards for adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

Thoſe diſhoneſties and inhumanities which reaſon could not keep out of Laws, faith caſts away from private Chriſtians, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mire and dirt of a wicked world: thoſe moral virtues which reaſon could not elevate to the Creators glory, faith ſpiritualizes by a pure intention towards it.</p>

The believer ſees God in every creature, not only in the great Regions of Heaven and Earth, but alſo in the leaſt Atoms or particles of nature. <hi>I am,</hi> is diſcovered wherever there is any thing of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And as for <hi>Providence,</hi> reaſon hath not been much clearer among the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> touching it, then touching creation. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> holding the world to be eternally from God by emanation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as light from the Sun, muſt alſo hold its continuance to be in the ſame manner, and without any voluntary act, ſuch as <hi>Providence</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63874:14"/>is. God (ſaith he) is the firſt Mover, he moves the heavens and thoſe other bodies ſubalternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo God is the univerſal cauſe, and all the wheels in nature move under him; only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent things, which are not within the chain of natural cauſality, ſeem according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> not to be adminiſtred by God. <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who makes the world to conſiſt of a fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of infinite petit Atoms, owns no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all: God will not break his reſt and ſerene tranquility with any mundane affairs, and indeed in reaſon a world made by chance muſt be ſo governed. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> brought in a <hi>Fate,</hi> or abſolute neceſſity, reſulting out of a <hi>ſeries</hi> or connexion of cauſes, and binding God himſelf as well as other things. <hi>Plutarch</hi> relating how <hi>Timoleon</hi> was ſtrangely delivered from two murderers, inſtead of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a Providence, wonders at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Nay, meer reaſon is apt to vilifie the great works of God: thus ſome ſaid that <hi>Moſes,</hi> in ſtead of dividing the Sea, did but take the advantage of a low Tyde to carry the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> over the waſhes, when it was low water. But when the light of faith comes, the hand of God is ſeen in every thing, not only in the great moments of nature, but even in <hi>the fall of ſparrows</hi> and <hi>numbring of hairs.</hi> Thus far of Reaſon with the Creature-glaſs before it, but to go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take reaſon with the Scripture-glaſs before it, and this ſupernatural light is yet above it. And here I muſt firſt admit what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63874:15"/>reaſon under the influence of a common bleſſing can do; and then ſhew, how much ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light doth tranſcend it. Reaſon under the influence of a common bleſſing may attain a rich furniture of humane learning, and ſo peruſing the holy Scriptures, may underſtand them by Tongues critically, and by School-divinity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and by Logick in the conſequences and connexions, and by Hiſtory in ſome Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal parts, and by Rhetorick in the tropes and figures, and by Comments in the abſtruſe and difficult places; and conſequently it may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a great notion of Divinity, much larger in the extent and latitude thereof then the knowledge of many true believers. Yet after all this notional knowledge attained, there is in the meaneſt true believer an higher and diviner light, a thing above meer reaſon and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this I ſhall demonſtrate ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The light of reaſon with all its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired notions is not a light as yet congruous to the things of God, which are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only by a ſupernatural light. To make out this, it will be worth our while to conſider that famous place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. where the Apoſtle clearly diſtinguiſhing two ſorts of men, <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man</hi> and <hi>the ſpiritual;</hi> and two ſorts of <hi>ſpirits,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit of man</hi> making the natural man, and <hi>the ſpirit of God</hi> making the ſpiritual man; and two ſorts of objects, the things of man, which are the line of knowledge to the natural man endued with an humane ſpirit, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63874:15"/>the things of God, which are the line of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the ſpiritual man endued with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; Poſitively lays down this <hi>Theſis, the natural man</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſoully man, or the man that hath only a rational ſoul, <hi>receiveth not</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as a full veſſel is not capable of the things of the ſpirit of God, <hi>for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> ver. 14. In this <hi>Theſis</hi> the Apoſtle by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſoully man, doth not mean a ſenſual man, who hath defloured his reaſon with ſenſual indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for then he would not have diſtinguiſhed between the natural man and the ſpiritual, but between the ſenſual man and the rational; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he have diſtinguiſhed between the ſpirit of man and the ſpirit of God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpirit of man or reaſon drowned in ſenſual pleaſures, and the ſpirit of man or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon keeping its ſtation and juſt authority over the ſenſual appetite; neither doth the Apoſtle here mean a natural or rational man ſitting in Pagan darkneſs, without the Goſpel, for he ſaith, <hi>the natural man receiveth not the things of God,</hi> which imports an offer of the Goſpel to him, <hi>and he receiveth them not, becauſe they are fooliſhneſs to him:</hi> which they could not be, if altogether unknown; and (ſaith he) <hi>he cannot know them,</hi> why? not becauſe they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally propounded (which is the Pagans caſe) but becauſe they are <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here meaneth by the natural or ſoully man, a man of reaſon, and that never forfeited
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63874:16"/>by ſenſual luſts, and a man of reaſon with the Goſpel ſet before him; and ſo his concluſion is this, <hi>A man of reaſon with the Goſpel before him, cannot receive or know the things of God.</hi> But you will ſay, if this be ſo, how can a man of reaſon with the Goſpel before him, arrive at ſo great a notion of Divinity, as is before admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I anſwer, the key to open this is in the Text, <hi>the natural man cannot know the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> A man by reaſon and its furniture of learning may in the peruſal of the holy Scriptures gather up a world of notions, and ſo know the things of God notionally; but he knows them not <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> and by conſequence not congruouſly to their ſpiritual nature. For the opening of this, we muſt conſider, that there is in the holy Scriptures ſomething <hi>humane,</hi> or which may be inventoried among the things of man, as the letters and words made up of them, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences made up of words; not as if theſe were not dictated exactly by God himſelf, but that they are common to humane and profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: I mean not for the divineneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but for the phraſes and forms of ſpeech. And there is in them ſomething <hi>Divine,</hi> or which muſt be computed among <hi>the things of God,</hi> as the myſteries and ſpiritual things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which are repreſented by thoſe words and phraſes. I may illuſtrate this diſtinction farther by that of our <hi>Saviour, If I have told you earthly things, and you believe them not, how ſhall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63874:16"/>Joh.</hi> 3.12. I pray, what earthly things did our Saviour tell them? was not he there preaching on that divine Theme of Regeneration? Very true, but Chriſt ſpake to them of Regeneration under the ſhadow of a birth and a wind, and not according to the heavenly and ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof in it ſelf. Thus the words and phraſes in Scripture, being of common uſe, are as it were humane types and ſhadows, but the myſteries and ſpiritual things themſelves are altogether divine. Now to apply this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reaſon improved, reaching to the things of man as its proper line, may know the words and ſentences in Scripture, and ſo gather up a great notion of Divinity: But, unleſs inlightned by the holy Spirit, which ſearcheth the things of God, it goeth not beyond its own line, it knows not <hi>ſpiritual things ſpiritually.</hi> Reaſon without the light of faith, Take it in a <hi>Jew</hi> at a Sacrifice, and it ſaw the <hi>type</hi> only, and not <hi>Chriſt</hi> in it. Take it in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at the holy Supper, and it ſees only the outward elements, and diſcerns not the <hi>Lords body.</hi> Take it in the greateſt <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſitting with the Scriptures before him, and it ſees them only in the ſhell or letter, and not in the myſtery. And no wonder, for even in common Sciences it may be ſo; a man may conſtrue and know the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar of a principle in <hi>Euclide,</hi> and yet be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Mathematical ſenſe of it; much more in divine truths may a man be ſpiritually igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who knows a great deal literally. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Scholars may do well in their ſtudies to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63874:17"/>do as <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did, who having arrived at Arts and Tongues, yet in the reading of the holy Scriptures, looked up to heaven. As for the great Doctor the holy Spirit, when he comes in ſupernatural illumination, then we know the things of God, not by our own ſpirit but Gods, the very ſame ſpirit which breaths in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhines in the heart. Hence ſpiritual things are diſcerned ſpiritually, by a light congruous to their nature; the ſpirit <hi>glorifies and ſhews forth Chriſt,</hi> as the expreſſion is, <hi>John</hi> 16.14. Holy truths are as it were transfigured and ſhewn forth in glory, which before were ſeen but in the fleſh or weakneſs of the Letter; the Deity ſparkles out in the beauty and ſpiritual luſtre of Scripture-myſteries, which before only appeared in the humanity of words and phraſes. Now heaven opens, and free-grace paſſes before us, <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with us,</hi> and we are of his Privy Councel. This is the firſt and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental difference, Reaſon with all its acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red notions is not a light congruous to ſpiritual things, but the light of Faith is: Out of this all the other are derived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meer Reaſon digging in the Letter of Scripture, arrives but at notions and ſhadows of knowledg, and though theſe be as the ſands on the ſea ſhore, they are but <hi>a form of knowledg, Rom.</hi> 2.20. but when the light of faith comes, there is <hi>ſound wiſdom, Prov.</hi> 3.21. or, as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word is, <hi>eſſence;</hi> a thing which can no more be made up of meer notions, then a body can of ſhadows. Faith is the <hi>ſubſtance or ſubſiſtence of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63874:17"/>things hoped for, Heb.</hi> 11.1. Without it, notions and literal knowledge have no <hi>hypoſtaſis</hi> in the heart; the ſpiritual world is as it were loſt; God and Chriſt and Heaven, are but notions: But as ſoon as faith comes and makes the day-break in the heart, the ſpiritual world ſubſiſts afreſh. God is God, and Chriſt is Chriſt, and Heaven is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſoul, all of them are reallized by faith; there is a <hi>good treaſure in the heart,</hi> far more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial then Arts and Tongues and School-noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can make.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Reaſon with its notions arrives but at a <hi>knowledge falſly ſo called,</hi> for it knows not the things of God as they are propoſed to be known; thoſe things are propoſed to be known not as meer notions, but as practical things: to be in the firſt place choſen, loved, embraced and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, but it knows them only notionally and not practically. That knowledge, whileſt materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true, hath a ſecret <hi>lye</hi> in it; thus the Apoſtle, <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandements, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4. 'Tis not in him in a practical way, ſo as to ballance the will and affections with the excellency of the things known; but as ſoon as faith comes, thoſe things are known as they are propoſed to be known, as practical things to be improved in heart and life. The ſupernatural light digeſts truths into blood and ſpirits, and turns myſteries into godlineſs. It knows Law and Goſpel in their true tendency, which is holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not to be holy is to blaſt and prophane the meaning of both.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63874:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The meer notional knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by reaſon hath no <hi>ſpiritual life or ſenſe in it,</hi> it hath no life in it; meer notions are but a <hi>dead faith,</hi> but faith is a living notion. In an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer the notions are all dead, affording no pulſe of holy affections, or motion of true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they are all buried in a grave of corruption and covered in the duſt of earthly things: But as ſoon as faith comes, there is a reſurrection in the ſoul, the notions before dead now wake out of the duſt, and riſe in life and power, every truth lives in the heart, and ſprings up into the new-creature. This ſupernatural knowledge is <hi>a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of life, Prov.</hi> 16.22. and all the vital acts of grace ſtream from thence. Nay, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>it is life eternal, John</hi> 17.3. heaven doth dawn and appear in it. Meer notional knowledg hath no ſpiritual ſenſe in it; the unregenerate man with all his notions, lies as a man in a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,</hi> never feeling the weight of ſin and wrath, though heavier then rocks and mountains; nor indeed ſavouring the ſweetneſs of Chriſt and grace, though infinitely out-reliſhing all the things in nature. But as ſoon as faith comes, there are all the ſenſes of the inward man, a <hi>ſeeing</hi> the <hi>ſun of righteouſneſs, an hearing the ſweet charms of Goſpel-grace, a ſmelling</hi> the <hi>odours of Chriſt, and the holy unction, a taſting how good and gracious the Lord is,</hi> and a <hi>touching and handling the word of life.</hi> The Learned Anatomiſts curiouſly pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head to find out the <hi>commune Senſorium,</hi> where all the ſpecies and images of ſenſible things meet together. In the ſpiritual man faith is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63874:18"/>an univerſal ſenſe, taking in all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> and images of heavenly things into the heart. The learned <hi>Junius</hi> with all his notions, coming into a poor Country mans houſe, and hearing him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe warmly and feelingly of Chriſt, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thought that Religion was more then a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thereupon reflecting on himſelf, was turned unto God, and no doubt ſound by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that faith was much fuller of life and ſenſe then meer notion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The meer notional knowledge gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in by reaſon <hi>puffeth up,</hi> as if ſome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents poiſon were in it, it blows up the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to proud reflexes. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> to keep his mind from ſwelling, uſed to ſweep rooms and waſh veſſels. I ſuppoſe it was, leſt his School-notions ſhould ſwell and make a tumor in his heart. But the light of faith is an humbling thing. <hi>If it enter in within the vail, and ſee God on his Throne,</hi> it cries out as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Wo is me, I am undone.</hi> If it fly up to <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſenſe the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and lightnings of the fiery Law, it puts the ſoul into a trembling ſit. If it go a pilgrimage to <hi>Calvary,</hi> and there take a view of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is greatly abaſive, bowing the heart down under the conſcience of ſin. If it look inwardly into the heart, and there ſee the ſilthy and naſty corruptions in every corner, it will far more humble then <hi>Bonaventures</hi> ſweeping and waſhing. And the reaſon of this difference is, meer notions are but the progeny and iſſue of our own reaſon, and therefore we are apt to be fond and fall a cockling of them. But ſupernatural
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63874:19"/>light comes from above, and is uſhered in with a kind of majeſty, and therefore humbles and makes us fall down and ſay, <hi>God is in it of a truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The meerly notional knowledge is but <hi>ſuperficial,</hi> a flaſh and away, <hi>a light taſt,</hi> ſuch as was in thoſe Apoſtates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. a word ſown but unrooted, ſuch as that in the ſtony ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. But the light of faith is another thing, it is <hi>truth in the hidden parts, Pſal.</hi> 51.6. <hi>wiſdom entring into the heart, Prov.</hi> 2.10. <hi>and a word ingrafted or innaturalized in the mind, Jam.</hi> 1.21. As an appendix to this difference, I may add another; meer notions, being but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial things floating in the brain, do not ſo eſtabliſh the heart in Religion, as that ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light which intimately mixes it ſelf with the heart. Hence many Princes and Grandees of the Letter have been ſick with intellectual bottles, and ſhamefully reeled up and down in Articles of Faith. Some ſtumbling in the mire of groſs <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and others rowling in the ditch of foul <hi>Socinianiſm;</hi> with them Chriſts Deity is but <hi>ſomnium Athanaſii,</hi> and original ſin but <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtini ſigmentum,</hi> ſuch horrid ſpuing from learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mouths hath been made on the glory of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And no wonder, for the notionaliſt wants that <hi>love of the truth,</hi> which is an antidote againſt errors, and that <hi>pure conſcience,</hi> which is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of Divine myſteries. On the other hand, ſupernatural light is a more eſtabliſhing thing: the Apoſtle calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the firmament of faith, Col.</hi> 2.5. all the heavenly truths are there as ſo many fixed ſtars in their Orb. <hi>Gerſon</hi> relates
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63874:19"/>this ſtory, A man vexed with doubts in Articles of Faith, at laſt came to ſuch a certainty in them, that he no more doubted of them then of his own life; and this he had (ſaith he) <hi>Non ex ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione aut demonſtratione, ſed ex humiliatione ac admirabili quâdam Dei illuminatione à montibus aeternis.</hi> All grace, becauſe divine, hath an eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing property, and among the reſt, ſo hath the light of faith, becauſe it comes from the <hi>eternal mountains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Meer notions are very apt to fume up into niceties and vain curioſities. A famous inſtance of this we have in the School-men, whoſe books are the ſpiders houſe, made of cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs and fine ſubtleties, and thoſe ſpun up into the Palace of the celeſtial King, and there faſtned upon the ineffables of God and the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as if theſe might be wrapped up in the quiddities of reaſon and Philoſophy; inſomuch as a learned Divine, ſtartled at this audacious vanity, ſaith, he reads the School-men about ſuch things, as he hears men ſwear or take Gods name in vain, even ſeldom, unwillingly, and with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And the learned <hi>Capito,</hi> who profeſſed Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical Divinity, was ſoon weary thereof, becauſe there is <hi>ſubtilitatis multum, utilitatis parum,</hi> found therein. But ſupernatural light doth not vapor upwards into niceties and curious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, but influence downwards into the will and affections. It brings <hi>the day of power</hi> into the heart, and makes <hi>a willing people,</hi> the holy uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drops from the head to the heart, and ſets all on a flame with love to God and Chriſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63874:20"/>things: wiſdom ſpeaks <hi>excellent things, Prov.</hi> 8.6. or, as the original is, it ſpeaks <hi>princes or princely things,</hi> holy things are ſuch in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But when they are taken in by faith, they have a mighty power in the ſoul: Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Abraham,</hi> entring by faith, wrought down into his <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>he offered up his Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack.</hi> Gods warning to <hi>Noah,</hi> entring by faith, wrought down into his <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>he prepared an Ark.</hi> The word works <hi>effectually in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> filling the inward man with holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the outward with holy fruits. I ſhall conclude this difference with an excellent <hi>ſimily</hi> of a worthy Divine; <hi>A child and a man come into a corn field together, the child falls in love with the blue and red weeds, but the man is for the ſolid corn: a man of meer notions falls in love with curioſities, and fine ſpeculations, but a man of ſupernatural light is for the ſpiritual and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truths in Scripture;</hi> theſe are the corn his ſoul muſt live upon, whileſt the other are but gaieties, and for a ſhew.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have ſpoken, what this ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light is. I ſhall now proceed to ſhew that it is requiſite to faith: and this will appear in the particulars following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Unleſs a man know that God is, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe; how can he reſt on the teſtimony of him, whom he knows not, to have a being? This propoſition, <hi>Deus eſt,</hi> is according to <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> the preamble of faith: Nay, in the Apoſtle, it is the firſt fundamental faith, <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, Heb.</hi> 11.6. But you will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63874:20"/>ſay, What need ſupernatural light for this? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon make this known; and indeed they do ſo, but ſo weakly, as not to raiſe up any one faculty in fallen man unto God his Creator. Never did natural light ſo ſhew a God, as to raiſe up his love out of this vain world, nor as to raiſe up his faith out of creature-confidences unto God. Wherefore this firſt principle muſt be ſeen by a ſupernatural light, which is indeed a middle kind of light, between the light of glory above, and the light of nature below: <hi>It ſees the inviſible one,</hi> not as the bleſſed Saints ſee him in the heavenly viſion, nor as the meer Naturaliſts ſee him by the glimmerings of reaſon, but in a middle way of gracious illumination. This our Saviour calls <hi>eternal life, Joh.</hi> 17.3. heaven dawns in it, and nature is illuſtrated by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the firſt ſtep of knowledge in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to faith, is <hi>Deus eſt;</hi> ſo the ſecond is, <hi>Deus verax,</hi> God is true, yea truth it ſelf, and the firſt archetypal truth, his teſtimony is infallible, and all his words <hi>Yea and Amen.</hi> Unleſs this be known, a man cannot believe him as a God; the believer <hi>ſets to his ſeal that God is true.</hi> And, if he did not know it, his ſeal would be to a blank: and though natural light reveal the truth and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God; yet, as I ſaid before, weakly, and therefore ſupernatural is required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third ſtep of knowledge in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>r to faith, is <hi>Deus dixit, ſeu revelavit,</hi> God hath ſpoken or revealed himſelf in the Scriptures. Theſe are the very words and teſtimony of God himſelf. If a man do know that God is, and is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63874:21"/>true, yet unleſs he know that God hath ſpoken in the word, that there is his very teſtimony, he cannot believe. Should we ask a man, why do you believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Redeemer of the world? it would be no rational anſwer for him to ſay, I believe it, becauſe God is true: No, though God be the firſt infinite truth, yet unleſs he ſpeak and teſtifie ſo much, it cannot be believed upon his teſtimony or authority, the only ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwer is this, <hi>I believe it, becauſe God, who is true, hath ſpoken and revealed it.</hi> It is neceſſary to faith, to know the holy Scriptures to be the word and teſtimony of God; that God ſpeaks and reveals himſelf in them, and this cannot be known without ſupernatural light. To explain which, I ſhall lay down two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are in the holy Scriptures cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or internal marks, whereby it may be known, that the Scriptures are the word and teſtimony of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or internal marks cannot be known without ſupernatural light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are in the holy Scriptures certain marks or characters whereby they reveal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the very word of God, even as the Sun manifeſts it ſelf by its own light. There is <hi>a Majeſty in the ſtile;</hi> what book or writing ever run in ſuch a ſtrain, as <hi>thus ſaith the Lord?</hi> where before it was there ever any univerſal Law made unto all mankind, Kings and beggars without diſtinction? who ever before comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded obedience upon pain of eternal torments in another world, or allured obedience with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63874:21"/>of everlaſting glory there? The fiery Law carries an awe with it, as if the thunders and lightnings of <hi>Sinai</hi> were not yet over: And in the Goſpel the kingdom of heaven approaches and opens it ſelf to believers, as it were in ſparkles of glory. Again, <hi>there is a treaſure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine myſteries, touching the ſacred Trinity.</hi> Nature is mute, but Scripture ſpeaks out; Reaſon is but a little child, and cannot paſs this infinite Abyſs, unleſs Faith in the word take him upon his back and carry him over. Touching that Incarnation of the Son of God, never any natural man dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſo much as ſtarted a thought of it; but in Scripture this and all the train of myſteries in our Redemption break forth in their glory. That book, which hath ſuch and the like myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, infinitely tranſcending all the thoughts and reaſons of man, doth by them ſhew that it came out of the boſom of God himſelf. Again, <hi>there is an unparallel'd purity in it,</hi> ſuch as is no where elſe to be found. This Sun hath no ſpots in it, this Diamond hath no flaws in it, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrene or carnal in this heavenly piece, as long as it hath ſtood in the world: not a duſt or a dreg can be found therein, neither ever did or will it licence the leaſt of erratas in man: In its pure ſpiritualneſs, it caſts a chain upon the very thoughts and firſt motions of ſin, and traces up ſin to the black neſt of corruption in lapſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it calls for <hi>a pure heart,</hi> made from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>new-creation,</hi> and the nobleſt births of Reaſon and Morality will not ſerve the turn. Such things as theſe are not ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63874:22"/>much as named in the writings of the worlds Sophies. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> never arrived at ſuch notions. Moreover, <hi>it hath a wonderful efficacy on the hearts of men;</hi> it looks into the inmoſt cloſet and retiring room of the heart; and, like Chriſt, it comes and ſtands in the midſt of it: when all the doors are ſhut by obſtinacy and unbelief, it awakens and alarums the ſleeping ſinner, and makes ſuch impreſſions and deep wounds in the conſcience, that it plainly appears no leſs then the arm of God was in it. It <hi>Evangelizes</hi> the heart, and turns it into its own nature, that it may be a <hi>Temple</hi> for that ſpirit which breaths in the Goſpel. <hi>It comforts the heart, and fills it with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> That place <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. was to <hi>Luther porta Paradiſi,</hi> the door of Paradice; and that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. was a ſea of ſweetneſs to holy <hi>Bilney:</hi> ſuch activities as theſe are above the ſphear of nature, and ſpeak no leſs then the divine extraction thereof. Laſtly, to name no more, <hi>the very plot and deſign of the Scriptures is tranſcendently divine;</hi> all the holy lines run into that central divinity, that God is to be <hi>exalted,</hi> and man <hi>debaſed.</hi> Oh! what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſelf-denial doth it call for? how doth it labour to <hi>un-ſelve,</hi> and as it were <hi>un-man</hi> us, that God may be all in all? There Reaſon, as fair a Jewel as it is muſt vail its beauty in an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of its own folly, and yield up it ſelf to be new lighted from heaven. The Will, as free an Empreſs as it is, muſt lay by its Crown in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of its ſpiritual ſlavery, and yield up it ſelf to be made free by grace. The Man muſt be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63874:22"/>no longer a man <hi>in himſelf,</hi> but a man <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> clothed in a better righteouſneſs, and acted by a higher ſpirit then his own. And how doth it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the glory, and blazon the arms of God? how admirably doth it ſet him forth in all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes? his <hi>eternity is the rock of ages, his immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability an invariable and inconvertible Sun, his righteouſneſs like the great mountains, his decrees and judgments a mighty deep, his mercy a glory, a maſs of riches never to be told over, his holineſs as the pure unmixed light, his juſtice as the devouring unquenchable fire;</hi> In a word, there all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Attributes paſs before the believers eye: ſuch a book as this muſt needs be divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Theſe marks or characters in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be known without ſupernatural light.</hi> Meer reaſon receiveth them not; like the child <hi>Samuel,</hi> it hears a voice, a ſound of words, but it knows not that it is the Lord: inſomuch that ſome have ſlighted the Scriptures. <hi>Politianus</hi> ſaid, that he never ſpent time to leſs purpoſe then in reading them; and <hi>Julian,</hi> that there was as good ſtuff in <hi>Pindars Odes</hi> as in <hi>Davids Pſalms.</hi> Had they known the word or teſtimony of God in them, they would not have crucified them by their wretched blaſphemies: But when the light of Faith comes, the Scripture appears not in letters and words only, but in the divine and heavenly characters, and by theſe it bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it ſelf, that it is the word of God. There is a double cauſe of Faith, an <hi>effective</hi> cauſe and an <hi>objective:</hi> the effective cauſe is the holy ſpirit inlightning the underſtanding and moving the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63874:23"/>will; and the objective is the Scripture it ſelf, by its own innate light and Majeſty revealing its divinity to the inlightned ſoul. <hi>Tertullian</hi> having this holy light in him, <hi>adored the fullneſs of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeemeth to be taken to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>purity</hi> of it, as not admitting ſo much as an officious lyc. Whereſoever the ſupernatural light comes, the Scripture manifeſts it ſelf to be divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth ſtep of knowledge in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Faith, is <hi>Deus revelavit Evangelium, God hath revealed a Goſpel,</hi> a way of ſalvation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs. Faith (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) is not a meer belief of the divine teſtimony, but a dependant reſignation to God and Chriſt; and to this reſignation no man arrives, unleſs he firſt ſee an overtopping ſuperlative excellency in the Goſpel, outbidding the world and all the luſts thereof; and verily believe that there and there only is the way of life and happineſs: And thus to ſee and believe is beyond the line of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and all its acquired notions. The natural man in the midſt of all his notions carries a falſe bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in his heart, which makes as if every trifling vanity did out-weigh God and Chriſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things and whileſt the ballance is thus, he cannot reſign: and thus it will be till ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light come, then and not till then doth the ballance turn by a right eſtimate of the Goſpel and the promiſes thereof. <hi>The ſpirit inlightning,</hi> and not humane reaſon, <hi>takes the things of Chriſt, and ſhews them forth in their glory, Joh.</hi> 16.14. And in this way God works the heart to reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the ſecond part of Precious Faith, the belief of the Teſtimony of God in the Scriptures: What manner of belief it is, and the conſequents of it, in order to an holy ſelf-reſignation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THUS far of the firſt thing in Faith, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural illumination. I now proceed to the ſecond, <hi>A belief of the teſtimony of God in the Scriptures:</hi> and here I need uſe no words to prove this belief an ingredient in Faith, for faith in the <hi>Grammatical</hi> notion of it, is nothing elſe but a belief of a Teſtimony; and, being applied to God, it is a belief of his Teſtimony in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Only I ſhall open two things; firſt, what manner of belief of the divine teſtimony in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures this is: and then, what the conſequents of it are in order to reſignation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What manner of belief this is. And this I ſhall explain in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This belief is divine, and congruous to the divine teſtimony.</hi> Such as the teſtimony is, ſuch muſt be the <hi>ratio credendi:</hi> the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a divine teſtimony, muſt be believed for themſelves, becauſe of the divine authority ſtamped upon them. Thus the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word, <hi>not as the word of man, but, as it is in truth, the word of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. they lodged the divine truth in a divine faith, which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63874:24"/>was a ſuitable entertainment. <hi>Humana omnia dicta teſtibus egent, Dei autem ſermo ipſe ſibi teſt is eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salvian,</hi> humane words want witneſs, but divine carry their own teſtimony in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To believe the Scriptures becauſe God ſpeaks in them, is a <hi>divine faith,</hi> but to believe them upon any other account, is below their divine authority, and but <hi>an humane faith.</hi> For example, to believe the Scriptures for the ſaying of the woman, for the Churches teſtimony, is but an humane faith, for it ſtands on no higher ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciment then an humane teſtimony, and therefore can be but an humane faith. Here the ſubtile Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite would help out the Papiſt at a dead lift: that faith (ſaith he) which is reſolved into the Churches authority is <hi>neque purè divina, neque purè humana, ſed quaſi media inferioris cujuſdam ordinis;</hi> but what ſaith the learned <hi>Pemble</hi> to him, Juſt ſo men uſe to ſpeak when they cannot tell what to ſay; It is <hi>Quaſi,</hi> and <hi>Aliquomodo,</hi> and <hi>Alicujus generis,</hi> it is ſomewhat, if they could tell what, thus he. 'Tis undoubtedly clear, that that faith <hi>which calls any man Maſter on earth,</hi> and centers on an humane teſtimony, ſuch as that of the Church, made up of men, muſt needs be, can be no other then humane. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Churches teſtimony may be <hi>inter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva fidei,</hi> but (if the faith be divine) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>inter formales rationes ſidei.</hi> A man in the dark labyrinth of nature may be led out by the Churches lamp, but when he is out, he ſees the Sun by its own light, he believes the Scriptures for their own divinity, though <hi>per miniſterium
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63874:24"/>Eccleſiae,</hi> yet not <hi>propter authoritatem Eccleſiae. Divine faith hath its Maſter in heaven, and its record on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Which follows on the other, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is a firm and ſtable thing, becauſe built on the divine authority of Scripture; <hi>we believe and are ſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 6.69. Nothing on earth can ſo aſcertain things unto us, as faith in the divine teſtimony. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate glorying in the Pagan learning, jeered at the Chriſtians, becauſe all their wiſdom was but in that one word <hi>Credo, I believe:</hi> but divine faith for all his prophane taunt, hath more firmneſs and real certainty in it then all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the world; for it ſees things <hi>in lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne veritatis primae,</hi> in the light of the firſt truth, and ſits even <hi>in the infallible chair;</hi> ſo that <hi>non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum,</hi> a lye cannot ſit under it, and glues the heart to the truth in that manner,<note place="margin">Eonav. l. <hi>3</hi> diſi. <hi>23.</hi> quest. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> that (as the <hi>Schoolman</hi> hath it) true believers, <hi>nec per argumenta, nec per tormenta, nec per blandimenta inclinari poſſunt, ut veritatem ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ore tenus negent,</hi> nothing could turn them away from the truth. So ſtrong a thing is faith, when it is ſet upon the rock, the teſtimony of God; but if it have an humane bottom only, ſuch as the Churches authority, it is weak and wavering, more like a fluctuating opinion then a faith. <hi>Durandus</hi> aſſerts, that Science is more certain than faith, and to that ſtrong objection, that the divine authority by which we believe, is more certain then any humane reaſon by which we know; he anſwers thus, <hi>Divina au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritas,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63874:25"/>propter quam credimus, licet ſit certiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma in ſe, non tamen nobis, qualitèr enim certi ſimus,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>quod Deus dicat ea quae credimus, non niſi quia ſic tenet Eccleſia? Obſerve,</hi> how this great Scholar abates the certainty of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he takes up the divinity of Scriptures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt from the ſaying of the Church; thoſe who build their faith purely on the divine word, ſpeak after another rate. <hi>Junius</hi> read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> cried out in a kind of amazement, <hi>Divinitatem argumenti &amp; authoritatem ſentio:</hi> and Reverend <hi>Calvin,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the queſtion how we ſhall be perſwaded that the Scriptures did flow forth from God; anſwers as roundly as a man doth touching that which is obvious and before his ſenſes,<note place="margin">Inſtit. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>perinde eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ac ſi quis roget, unde diſcemus lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem diſcernere à tenebris,</hi> the Scripture reveals it ſelf as the light doth, and to the pure eye of faith it appears divine from its own innate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and ſo eſtabliſhes the heart in its holy truth. To conclude this point, faith is a ſtable and firm thing; but, by the eſtimates and lives of men, there ſeems to be but a very little of it in the world. Did men, as they profeſs, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Scriptures, could they vilifie the commands of the great God as they do? The injunctions of earthly Princes are not ſerved ſo. Would they ſlight that wonderful charter of grace and glory in the Goſpel? a Patent of petty dignities and poſſeſſions here below will be highly valued by them: durſt they ſin as they do, in the face of hell and wrath flaſhing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63874:25"/>out of the divine threatnings? a Princes ſword or Gibbet would caſt them into a fit of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. O how ſoon would the things of God caſt the ballance in the heart, and outweigh all the world, if the Scriptures were indeed believed: but there being in men only <hi>levis opinatio,</hi> a light opinion rather then a ſolid faith touching the ſame, there neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues a monſtrous diſproportion between their faith and their life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This belief muſt be explicite as to the fundamentals of Religion.</hi> A meer implicite faith, as to believe in the lump, that all things contained in the holy Scriptures are true, will not ſerve the turn.<note place="margin">In Coloſſ. <hi>2.</hi> v. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Non eſt divina ſed belluina fides, quae nuliam habet conceptionem five compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſionem illarum rerum, quae creduntur,</hi> ſaith the excellent <hi>Davenant.</hi> A meer implicite faith without underſtanding is a bruitiſh thing; an explicite faith as to fundamentals is required: this will appear by theſe enſuing conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A meer implicite faith, if at any time might have paſſed for currant, in the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts Incarnation, whileſt religion was wrapt up in vails and ſhadows; but even then faith in holy men was explicite according to the meaſure of divine light imparted unto them: all along they looked to the <hi>Meſſiah, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed,</hi> and probably in an obſcure manner to <hi>his future ſufferings.</hi> Whileſt <hi>Adam</hi> was in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, there was no promiſe of a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> no footſtep of a <hi>ſacrifice;</hi> but as ſoon as man was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63874:26"/>fallen, out came that firſt Goſpel, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpents head, Gen.</hi> 3.15. and ſacrifices were ſet up: without doubt not without Gods appointment, for God <hi>had reſpect to Abels ſacrifice;</hi> which, had it been a piece of will-worſhip, could not have been, and <hi>Abol offered it up by faith, Heb.</hi> 11.4. which, without a divine word, moves not in the leaſt meaſure. Theſe ſacrifices were as it were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Commentaries on that firſt Goſpel, and <hi>types of a ſuffering Meſſiah.</hi> And if ſo and ſo by Gods own inſtitution, it is not at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that God ſhould hide the ſacred meaning thereof totally from the faith of the firſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Adam</hi> then, as I conceive, by the eyes of Faith ſaw <hi>the Meſſiah</hi> in that firſt Goſpel, and withall ſome glimmering of his ſufferings in the ſacrifices: And if he ſaw it, no doubt he did preach and reveal it to others,<note place="margin">Schola ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erif. Disp. <hi>4</hi>
                  </note> and probably (as <hi>Franzius</hi> conceives) in a ſolemn manner at the ſacrifices. <hi>Abel</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by faith offered up a ſacrifice to God,</hi> not only by ſuch a faith as did it in obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but by ſuch a faith, as through his own ſacrifice did pierce to the <hi>antitype, the great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Meſſiah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti l. <hi>1.</hi> ſect. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> Thus the learned <hi>Eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, cum ſacrificia Veteris Teſtamenti fuerint typi ſacrificii Chriſti, ea ſides intelligenda eſt, quâ ſacrificium illud refertur ad ſuum antitypum,</hi> ſuch a faith was proper to his ſacrifice. In <hi>Noahs</hi> ſacrifice <hi>the Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour,</hi> or <hi>a ſavour of reſt,</hi> ſuch as did (ſaith one of the <hi>Rabbins</hi>) make him <hi>ab irâ ſuâ quieſcere,</hi> reſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63874:26"/>from his anger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. and therefore ſurely there was more in it then meer beaſts and fowls. <hi>Noahs</hi> faith fetched in him, who was to give himſelf <hi>an offering and ſacrifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour. Abraham</hi> ſaw <hi>Chriſts day,</hi> that is, his coming and ſuffering in the fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. a very great ſight at that diſtance: and no doubt the faithful Seer did not conceal it, but tell his children and ſervants thereof for the glory of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> his joy was too great to hold it in privately to himſelf, and his zeal too hot to hide ſo much of heavenly glory. Under the Levitical Law the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to lay their hands on <hi>the head of the ſacrifice,</hi> as it were to disburden themſelves of ſin, and lay it off upon the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and by the offering up thereof, they were <hi>to make an atonement or expiation.</hi> The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers among them underſtood the outward rite of the ſacrifice; and did the faithful ones ſee no more in it? Could or did they imagine that a poor ſilly beaſt could ſtand under the weight of ſin, or that the blood of bulls or goats could take it away? No ſurely, their faith looked through the outward ſacrifice to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> for atonement and reconciliation. In <hi>David</hi> the Evangelical day broke out more clearly; O how much of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there in the <hi>110th Pſalm?</hi> there's his <hi>kingdom</hi> and <hi>eternal prieſthood;</hi> there's his <hi>paſſion</hi> in <hi>drinking of the brook in the way;</hi> there's his <hi>aſcenſion</hi> in <hi>lifting up the head;</hi> there's his <hi>interceſſion</hi> in <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand;</hi> there's his <hi>Church Catholick,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:63874:27"/>a <hi>willing people,</hi> made ſo by the power of his grace. This was <hi>Symbolum Davidicum, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Creed</hi> (as a learned man hath it) reaching in a manner as far as ours: Moreover, the Saints of old by their faith kenned a reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and life eternal. <hi>Jobs</hi> faith looked through worms and duſt to the viſion of God, <hi>Job</hi> 19.26. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith travelled beyond <hi>Canaan</hi> unto the <hi>heavenly city and country, Heb.</hi> 11.10. <hi>David</hi> is in a rapture at the <hi>full joys and right-hand pleaſures with God, Pſal.</hi> 16.11. When <hi>Cain</hi> talked with <hi>Abel</hi> his brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8. the Hebrew text ſets not down what he ſaid, but it hath an extraordinary pawſe, implying further matter; the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum</hi> ſays, <hi>Cain</hi> aſſerted that there was no judgment, no judge, no world to come, no rewards of evil or good; but believing <hi>Abel</hi> ſaid there were all theſe, and then his brother ſlew him: It ſeems the firſt fall out was about the future world.

Now to make my inference from all this; If faith were in a meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite in thoſe early Saints, who had but the twilight of the holy types, and cock-crowing of the Prophets; how much more ſhould it be ſo in us, who live in the noon-day of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and as it were directly under the Sun of righteouſneſs, in ſuch a Church-ſtate, wherein <hi>the leaſt is greater then John Baptiſt,</hi> we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63874:27"/>and ſpread abroad the fails of our faith to take in the larger gales and effuſions of the holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Faith, unleſs explicite, cannot arrive at thoſe ends for which it is ordained;</hi> viz. to raiſe up the heart to a reliance on the free grace of God in Chriſt, to inſlame the heart with the love of God and holy things, to ſanctifie the heart through the truth, and to overcome the world with its luſts: A meer implicite faith cannot reach theſe, it cannot raiſe the heart up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on Gods grace in Chriſt: to that reliance is prerequired not only a belief that God is true in the Scriptures in general, but alſo a belief that God is true in the precious promiſes in ſpecial: We are like <hi>Jacob,</hi> not believing in the mercies of God till we ſee the chariots, the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which he hath ſent down from heaven to carry up our faith to himſelf. <hi>They that know thy name, will put their truſt in thee, Pſal.</hi> 9.10. they and they only. Neither can it inflame the heart with the love of God and holy things: light and heat ever go together: Implicite faith is a dark and cold thing, affording no ſpiritual warmth at all; he that hath no more, is but a <hi>Nabal,</hi> a fool in religion, and his heart <hi>as dead and cold as a ſtone within him,</hi> till the love of God in the explicite notion of it ſhine into the ſoul; it will not, like the diſciples at <hi>Emmaus, burn within us</hi> with love to God and his ways: neither can it <hi>ſanctifie the heart through the truth, the word did not profit them not being mixed</hi> or tempered <hi>with faith</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63874:28"/>Where there is only an implicite faith, the word lies upon the heart all in a lump, whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted, affording no blood or ſpirits of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ſoul: it is explicite faith only which breaks the truth in the heart, and mixes and tempers every holy particle therewith, from whence the ſoul comes to be changed and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated into the truth, receiving a divine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from it, according to the meaſure of its faith, more or leſs digeſting the ſame truth in the heart; neither can it laſtly overcome the world and the luſts thereof, <hi>this is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world, even our faith,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. And this Faith doth, by putting a right eſtimate of things into the heart: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it manifeſtly appears, that heavenly things do infinitely outweigh earthly in themſelves, and ſhould do ſo in the minds of men. A man of a meer implicite faith, is a man without a ballance or judgment, he knows not how to eſtimate or weigh the excellent things of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ever poized down by the world and the luſts thereof. It is the explicite faith only which is in the ſoul as the ballance of the Sanctuary, rightly determining the true weight of things, and thereby giving heavenly things the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry above earthly in the heart. Oh! where this is, what a feather, a vanity, a nothing is the world? what in it can weigh againſt <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the exceeding eternal weight of glory?</hi> ſurely nothing; wherefore the followers of faith become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This belief muſt be total and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63874:28"/>without any ſalvoes or limitations. The Goſpel muſt captivate <gap reason="foreign">

The Reaſon muſt not go at large or random, but be kept in ſafe cuſtody under the Goſpel and the divine myſteries thereof; it is not to be truſted to, never ſince the fall put an enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into it againſt God. The <hi>Socinians</hi> believe the Scriptures only ſo far forth as they are congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to reaſon; thus <hi>Socinus</hi> profeſſes, that if this propoſition <hi>(that Jeſus Chriſt ſatisfied God for our ſins)</hi> were once and again extant in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred monuments, yet <hi>non ideirco,</hi> he would not therefore believe the thing to be ſo as we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily conceive of it: And another laies down this for a rule, <hi>Nihil credi poteſt, quod à ratione capi &amp; intelligi nequeat,</hi> that cannot be believed by faith, which cannot be comprehended by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It ſeems they will truſt God no further then they can ſee him, and depend more on their blear-eyed reaſon, then the divine oracle. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Socinian</hi> faith, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, firſt <hi>the inrationality of it,</hi> and then <hi>the nullity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, The Irrationality of it</hi> will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we diſtinguiſh between the two ſtates of <hi>reaſon,</hi> before the fall of man, and ſince. <hi>Reaſon before the fall was a pure and virgin light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpot in it,</hi> afterwards it was deſtoured and overſhadowed with the fall, and by that means all that is in the mind of man in his lapſed eſtate is not reaſon, the blinds and dark ſhades there are not ſo, but only that which is the relique of the pure primitive light, and congruous thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63874:29"/>the <hi>blemiſh</hi> in the eye is not the <hi>light,</hi> the <hi>ruſt</hi> in the <hi>gold</hi> is not the <hi>pure metal,</hi> neither is all that is in <hi>lapſed reaſon</hi> to be reckoned <hi>reaſon.</hi> If then in this caſe we would know what is <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> we muſt conſider what <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſo far as it is pure and right, doth dictate to us in this point: and what is that, but that <hi>God as the firſt uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable truth, muſt be believed in his words for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and above all other things,</hi> even above reaſon it ſelf?<note place="margin">Ronand. l. <hi>3.</hi> diſt. <hi>23.</hi>

Reaſon ſays, that God ſhould be believed <hi>as a God,</hi> one that cannot lye, no more then ceaſe to be; and if as a God, then for himſelf and above all. That in the <hi>Socinian,</hi> which adds a ſalvo to his belief of the holy Scriptures, is not his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the ruſt and proud fleſh and ſpiritual corruption of it; and to believe ſuch ſtuff before the truth of God, and make it the allay and ſupream ruler of our faith, is deſperately and monſtrouſly irrational. How this ruſt grew upon our reaſon at firſt, is evident in the fall of man, the Serpent creeps in upon the woman, with an <hi>yea, hath God ſaid? Gen.</hi> 3.1.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63874:29"/>his plot was to weaken the authority of Gods word, and when ſhe began to waver about it, and diminiſh the peremptory threatning of death, with a <hi>leaſt ye dye, v.</hi> 3. her reaſon began to corrupt and become dreggy, which, while pure, could not but aſſert the truth and veracity of God. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Church <hi>as a chaſt virgin eſpouſed to Chriſt,</hi> adds this caution, <hi>leaſt as the Serpent beguiled Eve, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> That is, take heed of falling off from the pure doctrine of the Goſpel, the head of every man is Chriſt, ſo much adherence and ſubjection as reaſon hath unto him and his holy truth, ſo much chaſtity and virginity it hath;<note place="margin">Virginitae mentis est integraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Auſt. in Joh.</note> but as ſoon as it elapes, it becomes an adultereſs, and ſhould not be ſuffered to ſpeak in holy things. Morcover, <hi>the irrationality</hi> of it will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider that the ſphear of reaſon and the ſphear of revelation are two diſtinct things. The ſphear of reaſon is filled with natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the elements of mans ſpirit; but the ſphear of revelation is filled with ſupernatural truths, the dictates of God; Reaſon, ſo far as it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is <hi>a divine ſpark, a petty Prince in its own dominions;</hi> but when it leaves theſe, and paſſes over into the ſupernatural region, and there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſitting down at Gods ſeet to be taught and inlightned, aſſumes the magiſterial chair, and falls a judging divine myſteries, it is no longer <hi>reaſon,</hi> but <hi>a fool and a brute,</hi> and ſpeaks as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in matters of Religion, as a beaſt, if it could
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63874:30"/>ſpeak would do in matters of reaſon. Thus when our Saviour diſcourſed <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about <hi>regeneration, reaſon</hi> prattled after a ſtrange rate, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb and be born?</hi> So ſooliſhly and abſurdly doth carnal reaſon carry it ſelf in ſupernatural things. To make this more plain, let us compare the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of reaſon with the ſublimity of holy myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and then the fallibility of reaſon with the certainty of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us compare the weakneſs of reaſon with the ſublimity of holy Myſteries. Reaſon, having a bruiſe in the fall, is weak even in its own ſphear: With how much toil doth it creep from letters to words, and from words to Arts and Sciences? And when it is there, how little doth it know? Can it ſpan the heavens, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the vaſt back-ſide thereof, or number thoſe golden letters, the ſtars therein, or underſtand the Sun, which to have done, <hi>Eudoxus</hi> would willingly have been burnt up by it, or in one of its beams: tell what light is, touching which there are no leſs then ſeven opinions in one of the Schoolmen, which verifies the old ſaying, <hi>Non conſtat ex lumine naturae quid ſit natura luminis?</hi> To come lower, can it enter into the treaſures of the ſnow, or ride a circuit with the winds, or take a rational turn with the flux and reflux of the ſea, or tell how the maſſie earth hangs upon nothing, or unkennel an occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and draw it out to an open view, or unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a loadſtone; in which a late Philoſopher
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63874:30"/>would have the atomes of both Poles to meet and incorporate? Nay, in a common ſtone, can it dive into the form or nature thereof, <hi>dic mihi, quid eſt lapiditas,</hi> ſaid a Learned man; can it ſtrip the meaneſt creature of the inveſting accidents, and look upon the pure naked eſſence thereof? can it comprehend a drop or a duſt, in which (ſaith the profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi>) there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite figures and numbers,<note place="margin">De Cauſâ Dei. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> pars <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> and conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Geometrical and Arithmetical concluſions, following one another in order, and having a mutual dependance between themſelves, ſuch as no Philoſophers can ever reach unto, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable only of finite concluſions, they leave behind them infinite unknown? Or, if it look about its own manſion-houſe, the brain, can it tell where the cells of memory, or the play-houſe of fancy, or the ſhop of the animal ſpirits are ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or whether all theſe live together in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? thouſands of ſuch things there are, which may make every one cry out with <hi>Socrates, Hoc unum ſcio, quod nihil ſcio.</hi> And ſhall ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as this, dunced and poſed in every atome within its own ſphear, uſurp the crown, and rule over ſacred myſteries, and pure revelations, which come out of the boſom of God, to be the wonder of Angels and faith of men, and are in a tranſcendent exceſs infinitely above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the capacity of both of them? ſhall it <hi>take up the ocean in a little ſhell, meaſure the ſacred Trinity in its ſhallow underſtanding:</hi> And, if it will not lye in ſo narrow a room, caſt it away as no article of Faith, as a thing <hi>inter impoſſibilia
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63874:31"/>mentis,</hi> not conſiſtent with reaſon? ſhall its dim eyes pry into the <hi>Ark,</hi> I mean, into that great myſtery, <hi>God in the fleſh;</hi> and there, becauſe it cannot ſee how two ſuch natures as mortal and immortal, temporal and eternal, mutable and immutable can come together into one perſon, throw it away, as <hi>Smalcius</hi> doth, with this, <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſanae repugnat, it is repugnant to right reaſon?</hi> When reaſon thus exalts it ſelf in the things of God, it ſinks below it ſelf into brutiſh irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us compare the fallibility of Reaſon, with the infallibility of Scripture. When the Papiſts lift up the <hi>Pope</hi> as ſupream judge in matters of Religion, it is a ſufficient anſwer to tell them, <hi>the firſt Clement</hi> held the Platonical community of all things, even of wives. <hi>Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſacrificed to Idols. <hi>Liberius</hi> ſubſcribed to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm. <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt taught that little ones could not be ſaved without the <hi>Euchariſt. Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was an <hi>Eutychian. Honorius</hi> a <hi>Monothelite. Hildebrand</hi> a brand of hell, and impiouſly dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical. <hi>John</hi> the 23th was accuſed <hi>in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Conſtance</hi> of this opinion, That the ſouls of men dye with their bodies, even as the ſouls of brutes; and ſhould ſuch be judges in matters of Religion? When the <hi>Socinian,</hi> by ſubjecting articles of Faith unto Reaſon, makes not one, but as many <hi>Popes</hi> as men, we need ſay no more to him, but <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> reaſon is a fallible thing. The Philoſophers were the Patriarchs of heretiques; <hi>Platonical Philoſophy in the Fathers, and Ariſtotelical in the Schoolmen, hath much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63874:31"/>debaſed the truths of God,</hi> ſaith a great Divine. All the errors and hereſies which have ſwarmed abroad in all ages, have been the progeny of corrupt Reaſon: upon this the devil begets all the black monſtrous opinions which crawl within doors in the Church, or without in the Pagan world. And ſhould ſuch a thing as this come and ſit in judgment on the pure words of God, which are ſurer then the voice of Angels, and ſtand faſter then the pillars of heaven and earth, which in ſo many ſucceſſions of Ages ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contracted the leaſt ſpeck of falſhood, or ſhed a leaf in the fall of the leaſt tittle or <hi>iota</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Surely, when reaſon thus forgets it ſelf and its own fallibility, it degrades it ſelf and becomes unreaſonable. Thus far <hi>of the irrationality of the Socinian faith.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The nullity of it</hi> is conſiderable, it is a nullity in its foundation, and at laſt it proves a nullity in the conſequence. It is a nullity in its foundation; the <hi>Socinian</hi> believes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures not as a divine teſtimony, but as congruous to reaſon, and ſo truſts not in God, but in himſelf and his own heart. Thus <hi>Socinus</hi> expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Non generalem comprobandi rationem quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus, quod eam, qui dixit, ejuſmodi eſſe appareat, ut nullâ in re mentiri poſſet, ſed ſingularem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, quâ id nominatim, quod comprobandum eſt, per cauſas &amp; effecia propria ita ſe babere demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratur, adeò ut non modò quia Deum ipſum dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe appareat, id verum eſſe conſtet, ſed etiam quia verum eſſe appareat, id Deum dixiſſe nobis certò perſuadeamus.

                     </gap> ſuam,</hi> ſaith a Learned man? how could he more clearly betray his infidelity? he would not have us only believe a thing true, becauſe God ſays ſo, but believe alſo that God ſays ſo, becauſe it appears true to our own reaſon, where this is the foundation, faith is a meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that which is a nullity in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at laſt proves a nullity in the conſequence. Reaſon, corrupting it ſelf in its own pride, caſts away the found principles of the Goſpel, and theſe being gone putrifies in abominable errors, like <hi>Herod</hi> aſſuming a Deity to himſelf, it is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually <hi>ſmitten of God, and eaten up of worms:</hi> I mean, thoſe errors which are but the putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of reaſon. How do the <hi>Socinians Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi> in worſhipping a creature, a Chriſt whom they deny to be God; <hi>Mahometize</hi> in denying the ſacred Trinity; <hi>Judaize</hi> in ſtanding for an interpreting <hi>Meſſiah</hi> only, and not a ſatisfying one; <hi>Manicheize</hi> in undervaluing the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; <hi>Arianize</hi> in denying the Deity of Chriſt; <hi>Pelagianize</hi> in denying original ſin; <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> in denying baptiſm to infants? how do ſome of them <hi>Divelaze</hi> in horrid blaſphemies, calling the ſacred Trinity <hi>tricipitem Cerberum;</hi> and to thoſe who aſſert Jeſus Chriſt to be Gods ſon; asking, <hi>An Deus habuit uxorem? Whether God had a wiſe?</hi> and ſuch like helliſh ſtuff, in which much of the devil appears. After all this fearful ſhipwiack of faith, what remains? too too little to denominate them Chriſtians. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> called the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> becauſe they denied Chriſts Deity, <hi>men-worſhippers;</hi> the antiont
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63874:32"/>Church ſtyled the <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> upon the ſame account <hi>God-killers;</hi> and a great Divine paſſed this cenſure on the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that they were <hi>a company of baptized Turks:</hi> indeed their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted reaſon diſſolves their faith into little or nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This belief muſt be ſuch as owns the holy Scriptures for the rule of faith; <hi>To the Law and to the teſtimony,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>If they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe, here is no light in them, Iſa.</hi> 8.20. As ſoon as the morning of faith breaks in the heart, the word is owned as the rule. <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> going oft from the Scriptures, take the ſpirit for their rule. <hi>Swenckfield</hi> was altogether for the ſpirit and the internal word, and little or nothing at all for the external. <hi>Henry Nicholas</hi> boaſting of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anointing, looked on the Scripture as a literal fleſhly elementiſh thing. <hi>John Valdeſſo</hi> ſaith, that Chriſtians may at firſt ſerve themſelves with Scripture as an Alphabet, but afterwards leaving it to beginners, they attend to their proper Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſpirit of God: Others ſay, the Scripture is but a dead letter, a thing of paper and ink, and we muſt not try the living by the dead, the holy ſpirit by the Scripture. Such as theſe, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their own revelations, call all other Chriſtians <hi>Vocaliſts</hi> and <hi>Literaliſts,</hi> becauſe of their adherence to the Scriptures. Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh</hi> makes three ſphears of adminiſtration, the Law or meer letter, the Goſpel which hath du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and grace in it, and the ſpirit, the pure ſpirit, which is the third heaven, higher then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63874:33"/>and ordinances. The <hi>Weigelians</hi> talk of a <hi>ſeculum Spiritus Sancti,</hi> in which there ſhall be higher diſpenſations then before, and we ſhall be wiſer then <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> make the light within, that is, as I take it, natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſtandard of all their actings. All theſe, though clothed in various words, agree together to crucifie the Scriptures, as if they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more noble. Unto them I ſhall offer ſome conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Apoſtles direction is, <hi>Try the ſpirits whether they are of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, try them, as Goldſmiths try metals by the touchſtone, or by the fire, or as Magiſtrates queſtion offenders, or examine thoſe that ſtand for an office, uſe all manner of ways to find out whether the ſpirits be right or not: upon this as a ſufficient warrant, I ſhall put ſome interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to the <hi>Enthuſiaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt the ſpirit of God is in thy heart, and is it not in the Scriptures too? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, is it not congruous and harmonious to it ſelf? And what doth it ſay in the Scripture? doth it not ſay, that the Scripture is the rule? <hi>To the Law and to the teſtimony,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>the Law of the Lord is perfect, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul, the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wiſe the ſimple,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Scripture is able to make us wiſe to ſalvation, and perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. &amp; 17. Nay, ſuch a rule it is, that <hi>nothing muſt be added to it, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed from it, Dent.</hi> 4.2. no not by an Angel.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63874:33"/>
                  <hi>If an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel to you, let him be accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1.8. And can the ſpirit in the heart contradict the ſpirit in the Scripture? can it be contrary to it ſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from its own oracles? no ſurely, defectible creatures may be off and on, yea and nay in their words, but the holy ſpirit cannot be ſo. The war between <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Magnentius</hi> was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as very portentous, becauſe therein firſt croſs was carried againſt croſs, and Chriſtians engaged againſt fellow-Chriſtians; but that the holy ſpirit ſhould make war upon it ſelf, is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous contradiction; which, if allowed, would leave no being to Gods veracity, nor ſtanding unto mans faith: But as portentous as it is, the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> muſt maintain it, unleſs he will confeſs that the ſpirit in him, which denies the Scripture to be the rule, is not of God.</p>
               <p>Again, thou ſaieſt thou haſt the revelation of the holy ſpirit, but how or in what manner doth it reveal it ſelf in thee? I ſuppoſe thou doſt not pretend to a Revelation made by viſions or dreams or audible voices, as it was wont to be of old, but to a revelation intellectual; and that is double, the one extraordinary in Prophets and Apoſtles, the other ordinary in all true believers. In the firſt revelation made to Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the holy ſpirit did immediately infuſe the <hi>ſpecies intelligibiles</hi> into their minds, and thereby did internally ſpeak, and in a proper ſenſe reveal things unto them. What we tranſlate <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word of the Lord by Hoſea, Hoſ.</hi> 1.2. is in the original <hi>the beginning of the ſpeech of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63874:34"/>in Hoſea,</hi> pointing out an internal locution to the Prophet. In the ſecond revelation made to believers, there is no ſuch thing as in the firſt, no immediate infuſion of <hi>ſpecies,</hi> no internal voice or locution, ſaying this or that is ſo, and therefore no revelation properly ſo called; but the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth enlighten their minds to make them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and then they hear what the holy ſpirit in the Scriptures ſpeaks unto them: thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> prays for <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation,</hi> not that they might have extraordinary inſpirations, but that <hi>the eyes of their underſtanding might be inlightned, Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. To know the witneſs of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the holy ſpirit doth not ſpeak to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned underſtandings immediately, but in and by the Scripture-medium, which is as it were <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtola Dei,</hi> Gods letter unto man. In the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the Prophets and Apoſtles, the holy ſpirit did ſo totally and in ſuch an extraordinary way govern them in their ſpeaking and writing, that therein there was <hi>nibil ſuum,</hi> nothing of their own, not only the matter, but <hi>quaevis vocula,</hi> every little word was of God: hence S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>moved or carried upon the wings of the ſpirit above humane frailty,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. In the ſecond revelation to believers, the holy ſpirit is as an holy anointing to their minds, and thereby puts them into a capacity to hear what God ſpeaks in the Scripture, but it doth not ſo totally carry and rule them, as to make their words purely divine and free from all mixture of their own. The firſt revelation to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63874:34"/>the Prophets and Apoſtles, being purely imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and extraordinary, makes authentical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The ſecond revelation to believers, being but ordinary, doth not make Scripture, but only capacitate their minds to take in the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit therein. Theſe things premiſed, I muſt renew my queſtion: Say, O <hi>Enthuſiaſt!</hi> what is thy revelation? is it a pure immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal locution? is it extraordinary and carried by the ſpirit above all humane frailty? may it be added to the Canon and become Scripture? I ſuppoſe thou canſt not, dareſt not ſay ſo; but if thou doſt, read and tremble at the ſealing up of the Canon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. <hi>If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues written in this book, and if any man ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city.</hi> Theſe words are as a flaming ſword at the end of the Bible, to keep thee from preſuming to put any thing thereunto: Say then modeſtly, is not thy revelation ordinary? did not the holy ſpirit come to thee in the chariot of the Scripture? and why then doeſt thou ſlight and undervalue it? why doeſt thou call it a dead letter, a fleſhly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentith thing, and the like? God hath ſpoken <hi>once, yea, twice,</hi> (if I may ſo allude) once in the Old Teſtament, and again in the New, expect not to hear his voice or ſpirit any where elſe but there; if thou doeſt, thou putteſt a cheat upon thy ſelf, and inſtead of a revelation, embraceſt a meer fancy.</p>
               <p>Again, the ſpirit is in thy heart, and the ſpirit
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63874:35"/>is in the Scripture, but where is the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it? ſay in good earneſt, is there a greater meaſure of the ſpirit in thy heart then in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? then thou canſt unriddle all the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the difficult knots in Scripture; thou canſt dive down into that divine abyſs, and fetch up all the holy myſteries there; thy holineſs can hold mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the length and breadth of the pure ſpiritual Law; thy faith runs parallel with all the promiſes, and can tell over all that infinite Maſs of free-grace which is couched therein: the helliſh root of bitterneſs once in thy nature, is quite eradicated, and not a ſtring of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence left behind; thou canſt ſay, <hi>I have no ſin,</hi> and which is the wonder, <hi>thy heart doth not deceive thee in ſaying ſo;</hi> there are no ſhades or dark ſpots in thy mind, no cracks or flaws at all in thy obedience, no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nothing lacking in thy faith or other graces: All in thy heart and life is as right as the rule, and as pure as the Chriſtal ſtreams in the Goſpel. If there be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of the ſpirit in thy heart then in the Scripture, thus it is with thee: but I hope thou art not ſo utterly void of the ſpirit and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to fall into ſo proud a dream of thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. If thou ſaieſt thou art clean, that very word pollutes thee, <hi>quiſquis ſe inculpatum dixerit, aut ſuperbus aut ſtultus eſt,</hi> whoſoever ſaith ſo, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fool or a proud man. Say then, as the truth is, there is a greater, incomparably greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſpirit in the Scripture, then in thy heart; and then tell me, what is fitteſt to be the rule, that which is perfect, or that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63874:35"/>that greater meaſure of the ſpirit in the Scripture, or that leſſer, far leſſer meaſure of the ſpirit in thy heart; common ſence will tell thee it belongs to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſpirit is in thy heart, and the ſpirit is in the Scripture, but where is it plaineſt and moſt obvious? where can it be moſt eaſily diſcerned to be the very ſpirit of God indeed? all that is in the Scripture is indubitably of the holy ſpirit, but all that is in thy heart is not ſo; it may be it is from thy own ſpirit, what thou didſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have been from Gods: nay it may be it is from <hi>Satan transforming himſelf into an Angel of light.</hi> The Diſciples would have called for fire from heaven as <hi>Elias,</hi> but Chriſt tells them, <hi>ye know not of what ſpirit ye are, Luk.</hi> 9.55. as if he had ſaid, you think this motion came from an extraordinary ſpirit, ſuch as was in <hi>Elias,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, it is but from your own ſpirit, nay from the gall and bitterneſs of it, <hi>that which you take for zeal, is indeed but revenge.</hi> When upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours diſcourſe of his ſufferings <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee,</hi> no doubt he thought himſelf right in the thing, but our Saviour calls him <hi>Satan</hi> for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.23. his meaning was pious, and as he might think, from the ſame holy ſpirit which a little before inſpired him to make a glorious confeſſion of Chriſt; but alaſs, the devil acted ſecretly therein. Of what I find in Scripture, I can immediately and without any more ado pronounce that it is the very voice of the holy ſpirit, but of what I find in my own heart I cannot do ſo. Firſt, the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63874:36"/>light muſt be divided from the darkneſs, Gods ſpirit muſt be diſtinguiſhed from mans and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans. And how ſuch a piece of ſpiritual Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould be done without the Scripture, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine: There may be three different ſpirits in my heart, and unleſs I reduce them in a way of trial to the one pure ſpirit in the Scripture, I may be eaſily cheated by my heart: wherefore the Scripture, in which the characters of the ſpirit are more plain and legible then in my own heart, muſt needs be the rule.</p>
               <p>Once more let me ask thee O <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> who crieſt up the ſpirit, the ſpirit above Scripture, doſt thou ſeek the ſpirit aright, or follow him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully? I fear thou doeſt neither. Thou doeſt not ſeek the ſpirit aright, becauſe not in his own way, which now is not in viſions and immediate revelations, but in the Scripture. Thou wouldeſt have the ſpirit, but wilt not <hi>ſtay upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Prophets and Apoſtles for him.</hi> Thou doeſt like <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary, they ſought Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their kindred and acquaintance, when he was in the Temple.</hi> Thou ſeekeſt the ſpirit among thy own fancies and imaginations, when he is in the Scripture, <hi>My ſpirit and my words ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of thy mouth,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the ſpirit and the word are by Gods own ordinance in a ſweet conjunction together, he that ſunders them loſes both of them. <hi>For a man to wave the Scripture and ſeek the ſpirit, is as if he ſhould forſake the beams, and ſearch after the Sun in ſome place where it ſhines not.</hi> The <hi>French Kings</hi> uſe to be crowned at <hi>Reims,</hi> becauſe there is the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63874:36"/>ſacred oil, which (as they ſay) came down from heaven. If thou wouldeſt be crowned with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdom, be in the Scriptures, there and there only is the holy Unction which will teach thee all things. Neither doſt thou follow the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as thou oughteſt: the ſpirit, if followed in his own way, will lead thee into all truth, but if thou wilt follow the ſpirit in an extra-ſcriptural way, thou doeſt not follow it indeed, but thy own fancy, and whileſt thou ſeemeſt to ſoar above Scripture, thou art like to fall far below it, into the ditch of error and wickedneſs. In no better place have thy predeceſſors been, after all their high-flying imaginations. <hi>Montanus</hi> that early Enthuſiaſt called himſelf the <hi>Paraclete,</hi> and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the writings of his two Propheteſſes above the ſacred Goſpel. The <hi>Meſſaliani</hi> thought they could corporeally ſee the ſacred Trinity, and dance upon devils, and receive the holy ſpirit in a viſible way? Oh Satanical illuſion! <hi>John of Leydens</hi> viſions teemed out Poligamy and a bloody Rebellion. Into what wild aſſertions did <hi>Swenckfield</hi> and <hi>Henry Nicholas</hi> come by their Enthuſiaſtical ſpirit, the firſt ſaying, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the Eſſence of God; nay, faith in the heart is ſo. The other blaſphemouſly alledging, <hi>That the believer is Godded with God, and the ſpirit of love is God incarnate?</hi> How did <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> run into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſm and Antinomianiſm? And what elſe did <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> in his book called <hi>Sparkles of Glory;</hi> making as if Chriſt were but a myſtical ſigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive man, and God in the fleſh were only God in his Saints? Oh myſtery of iniquity! whither
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63874:37"/>will not this extra-ſcriptural ſpirit go? what errors will it not broach? what ſacred founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truth will it not demoliſh? how little Goſpel or divine rule will it leave to Chriſtians? Leave it then O <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> or elſe thou canſt not follow the ſpirit of truth. Thus much by way of queſtion to the <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall in a word ſay ſomewhat to their Allegations: they ſay, <hi>That the Scriptures are but the Chriſtians Alphabet,</hi> and for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only. But let us remember, the ſpirit which is in believers in an ordinary way, was in the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Scripture in an extraordinary; <hi>I was in the ſpirit,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.10. he ſaith not, the ſpirit was in me, but I was in the ſpirit, as a veſſel in the ſea, every way ſurrounded and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruled by it. And who can believe that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in its ordinary way ſhould exceed it ſelf in its extraordinary; that in believers it ſhould ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter high myſteries, which in Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles gave out only an <hi>Alphabet?</hi> If it be no more, I dare ſay, no man, no not the moſt perfect Diſciple of God on earth ever throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Alphabet, no mans knowledge ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the bottom of Scripture, no mans holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ever parallel to its precepts, nor no mans faith ever traced the unſearchable riches of grace there unto the uttermoſt, and ſhall we ſay, it is only an Alphabet for beginners? Is it not <hi>the wiſdom of God in a myſtery? is it not able to make the man of God perfect?</hi> hath St. <hi>Paul milk only and not ſtrong meat?</hi> was St. <hi>Peter to ſeed the lambs only, and not to feed them into ſheep,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:63874:37"/>and when they were ſuch? doth St. <hi>John write on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the little children, and not to the young men and fathers alſo?</hi> He writes to them all, plainly ſhewing, that no man, of what ſtature ſoever in grace, did ever outgrow the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Again they ſay, <hi>the Scriptures are but a dead letter,</hi> and we muſt not try the living by the dead. The holy Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> long ſince ſtiled them <hi>lively oracles, Act.</hi> 7.38. and if they are now but a dead letter, who hath murdered them? who ſo much as the <hi>Enthuſiaſt?</hi> who goes about to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the ſpirit from them. If the Law come to a man in the convincing ſpirit, and ſlay him with his own guilt, and ſet his conſcience on fire with ſome taſts of hell, he may with the Apoſtle call it <hi>a killing letter,</hi> but he will hardly call it <hi>a dead one.</hi> If the Goſpel come to him in the converting ſpirit, and open the glories of free-grace, and bring in a new creation into his heart, he muſt confeſs, <hi>that it is the very ſavour of life unto life, and the power and arm of God to ſalvation;</hi> and as the firſt life of grace is breathed through it into the dead ſinner, ſo all the after-gales of the ſpirit come from it upon the new creature: Wherefore, whileſt the ſpirit is in the word, it cannot be a dead letter; and where the ſpirit is in the heart, it will not be called ſo. The <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> for all his ſwelling words of vanity, by calling the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a dead letter, proves only the deadneſs of his own heart; and the true believer, who owns the Scripture for his rule, doth not try the living by the dead, but the leſſer meaſure of the ſpirit in his heart, by the greater meaſure of it in the word.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:63874:38"/>
               <p>Again, they ſay there is a <hi>ſeculum ſpiritus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,</hi> an adminiſtration of all-ſpirit, which is much above all Scriptures and Ordinances; but that there ſhould be ſuch a Church-ſtate on earth is a vain dream. There are two manifeſtations of God unto men, the one dark and through the glaſs of ordinances, the other by pure and immediate viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it were face to face. There are two ſtates of believers, the one a ſtate of weak and imperfect graces, the other a ſtate of perfect holineſs and purity. There are alſo two places, the one is earth, a vale of tears and death; the other is heaven, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of all bleſſedneſs and life eternal. The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation by ordinances is congruous to weak graces, and ſuch a place as earth. The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by pure viſion is congruous to perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch a place as heaven. Thus hath the wiſdom of God ordered things. Methinks the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> ſhould bluſh to ſay that he is above Scriptures and Ordinances here. What? <hi>above the glaſs, and yet below the bliſs-making viſion; above the channels and methods of grace, and yet below a ſtate of perfection; above the heavenly mediums, and yet on earth?</hi> Oh ſtrange imagination! What ſaith our <hi>Saviour? Go, teach and baptize, loe I am with you always to the end of the world, Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. Ordinances run parallel with this world, and the ſtate which is above them, is only in the next. What ſaith St. <hi>Paul? Apoſtles, Prophets, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Paſtors, are all for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. Ordinances muſt continue as long as weakneſſes and imperfections, and cannot be ſpared till the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63874:38"/>top-ſtone of holineſs and perfection be laid in heaven. What ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly City? <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein, Rev.</hi> 21.22. No Temple, no Ordinances, is only for heaven, earth muſt alwaies want and have them. O my ſoul, enter not into their ſecret, which cry up the ſpirit, and deſpiſe propheſyings; be thou where Gods honour dwelleth; in the Temple of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thou mayeſt ſee his power and glory.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Quakers</hi> talk altogether of the light within; which, being as they ſay, common to all men, can be no other then natural conſcience: this is <hi>the candle of the Lord,</hi> and much magnified by Heathen Philoſophers; this is every mans <hi>Daemon,</hi> ſaith one: nay, it is <hi>the God in us,</hi> ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And it is ſo in ſuch a ſenſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>a God to Pharaoh,</hi> preaching the will of God to him; and for non-obedience, urging him with dreadful plagues: For it magiſterially dictates the will of God, even in the Monarchs of the world; and in caſe they rebel, it hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtings and ſcorpions for them. <hi>Quid aliud voces animam quàm Deum in humano corpore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitantem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> Were a <hi>Quaker</hi> to <hi>Engliſh</hi> it, he would go near to do it thus, <hi>The light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> for in plain terms he will call it Chriſt, as if the candle could becom a Sun of Righteouſneſs. In the mean time the devil hath a fetch, under the praiſes of inward light, to explode the Scriptures: But we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Conſcience which is above man, is yet below God; and though it be a light and a rule, yet it muſt truckle under the greater light
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63874:39"/>and rule in the Scriptures. Take conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion, it is clouded and overſhadowed with the Fall, dark and blind in ſpiritual things; and <hi>ſhall the blind lead the blind, till both fall into the ditch?</hi> muſt it not go &amp; be new-lighted at the Scripture? <hi>Take heed unto the word as unto a light ſhining in a dark place,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. The heart of man is but a dark place, till the divine word ſhine into it; it is intoxicated with the love of ſin, and by it, as the devils Opium, it ſleeps at the top of the maſt, in the ocean of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers, and muſt it not be rouzed up? ought not the ſilver trumpet of the word to be ſounded in its ears, to prevent an eternal ſleep, and awaken it unto righteouſneſs? ſhould it not go and waſh in the pure ſtreams of free-grace, and redeeming blood in the Goſpel? it may be it is infected with errors, and by theſe Satan hath taken ſanctuary in the intellectual tower, and utters his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates as from God; and muſt it be left in ſuch a caſe? ſhould not <hi>Satan</hi> and all his lying wares be caſt out by the word and ſpirit? but becauſe conſcience is now at the worſt, take it after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, are there then no reliques of darkneſs which call for more light? are there no fits of ſpiritual drowſineſs, which need freſh alarums? are there no dregs of corruption, which want a new purgation? are there no ſpots of error, which ought to be wiped out? he that preſumes a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from theſe, hath great reaſon to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch thing as converſion found in him; and he that confeſſes them, hath as great reaſon to run to the Scripture to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63874:39"/>But becauſe the <hi>Quaker</hi> dreams of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I will go higher. Suppoſe a man abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect, every wheel in his ſoul in right motion, and his conſcience a pure Chryſtal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any flaw in it, yet muſt the man be under God, and his conſcience under the word; for his very perfection ſtands in that ſubjection, and is forfeited as ſoon as it departs from it. Conſcience is a <hi>rule,</hi> but a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> one, it binds and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but in the power and authority of the word; take away that, and conſcience is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the <hi>inward Eccleiaſtes</hi> is ſilenced, and hath nothing to ſay. <hi>My conſcience beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, Rom.</hi> 9.1. Obſerve, <hi>it beareth witneſs in the holy Ghoſt; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu Sancto duce ac moderatore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza</hi> on the place. Conſcience is no ſupream thing, the holy Spirit muſt command and moderate in it, if not in an immediate way, as in Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yet in and by the ſacred Scriptures as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chriſtians. To conclude with that of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>Scripturis non loquentibus, quis loquetur? the Scripture being ſilent, none can ſpeak,</hi> no not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it ſelf in a regular way; wherefore our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream rule muſt be ſought no wher elſe but there.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have treated touching what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of belief of Scripture this muſt be. But to proceed on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are the conſequents of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in order to that reſignation, which is the laſt thing in faith? I anſwer, the holy ſpirit having lodged ſuch a belief of Scripture in the heart, doth reflect and turn the Scriptural light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63874:40"/>and manage it in order to reſignation, by ſo me ſuch ſteps as theſe following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ſtrikes in the holy light in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to work a clear conviction of ſin, and this conviction is manifold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, There is a conviction of ſin in its kinds, Actual</hi> and <hi>Original.</hi> I name <hi>Actual</hi> firſt, as being moſt obvious and firſt in the diſcovery. There is a conviction of <hi>Actual ſin;</hi> the believed Law comes home to the heart, and gives it a charge as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, thou art the man,</hi> theſe and thoſe things are ſins againſt the great God, ſaith the holy Law, and ſo and ſo thou haſt done, ſaith the awakened conſcience. God (who before had <hi>ſowed and ſealed up his iniquities in a bag,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Job</hi> 14.17.) now opens the bag, and pours out a vaſt ſum of guilts, and exactly tells over all the ſmothered light, and abuſed love, and ſpirit-quenchings, and ſorfeited creatures, and buried talents, and broken promiſes, and horrible preſumptions, in all amounting to wonderful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages, and at laſt enforcing the poor ſinner to cry out, <hi>Guilty, Guilty.</hi> And after this follows a conviction of <hi>Original ſin:</hi> The ſinner traces up his ſins to the impure fountain, and follows every luſt home to the black neſt in the heart; there, there is the root of bitterneſs, the ſeed-plot and ſpawn of all iniquity. Indeed in every actual ſin we may, if we have our ſpiritual ſenſes about us, hear the <hi>ſound of its Maſters feet,</hi> even of the reigning corruption within; in every act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion we may cry out of the <hi>Pharaoh</hi> within, which ſaith <hi>who is the Lord?</hi> in every act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63874:40"/>we may complain of the <hi>Jew</hi> in the heart, which will not receive Chriſt; we may taſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams apple</hi> in every ſenſual ſin, and perceive his <hi>imaginary Godhead</hi> in every ſpiritual ſelf-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; in our lives we have many ſins, but all in our heart; there is a ſtench in vitious actions, but the filthy ſink of all is within. After ſome ſuch way as this doth God fill our faces with ſhame, that we may ſeek him and reſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, There is a conviction of ſin in its guilt:</hi> The ſinner comes to ſee that whileſt he is in his ſin, he is but a condemned man; and ſin, unleſs pardoned, will chain him to hell and eternal wrath. God ſeems to ſpeak to him, as once to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech, behold thou art but a dead man,</hi> thou cateſt and drinkeſt and ſleepeſt, but all the while under wrath; thou art jolly abroad among the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but fire and brimſtone and an horrible tempeſt hangs over thy head. God makes the ſinner know where he is, as the <hi>Syrians,</hi> when their eyes were opened, <hi>ſaw themſelves in the midſt of Samaria;</hi> ſo he, when his mind is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, ſees himſelf at the brink of hell and death; without ſuch a ſenſe of wrath, man is too proud to reſign: he is naturally a <hi>Manaſſeh, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter of God,</hi> and will not turn till he be in chains. <hi>Laiſh</hi>-like, he ſits quiet and ſecure, till <hi>Dan</hi> the <hi>judgment</hi> come; hell muſt drive him to heaven or elſe he will never come there; <hi>the fiery Law muſt melt him, or elſe he will never run into the Goſpel-mould.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, There is a conviction of the filthineſs of ſin;</hi> the ſoul in every turn from God loſes its
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63874:41"/>light, and in every turn to the creature, gathers ſoil and pollution; the ſinner will never reſign up himſelf to be waſhed in the Evangelical la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, unleſs he firſt ſeo ſin, as it is, mire and dirt, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and find his pretious ſoul lying in a ſordid manner, in a ſink of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or a cave of covetouſneſs, or ſome other luſt, which is as an unclean place miſerably defiling it, whileſt it abides therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, There is a conviction of the power of ſin;</hi> ſin is a <hi>Baal,</hi> a Lording tyrant, and the ſinner a vaſſal to it; in ſenſual ſins he drudges in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in ſpiritual he is carried away to <hi>Babylon:</hi> the ſinner is as a captive in his chains, and (which is the great wonder) <hi>a willing cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> the iron is entred into his ſoul, the chain is in his very will the Principle of freedom, a vaſſal he is, and loves to be ſo. The more freely he ſins, the more is his ſlavery, the more imperiouſly he ſins, the more is his weakneſs: thus the Prophet, <hi>how weak is thy heart, ſeeing thou doeſt the work of an imperiou whoriſh woman? Ezek.</hi> 16.30. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God make men in ſome meaſure feel the power of ſin, and go as <hi>David</hi> over <hi>Olivet,</hi> weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe of the <hi>Abſoloms,</hi> the rebellious luſts, which come out of their own bowels and make war upon heaven, they will not reſign and take up the yoke of Chriſt as they ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon ſuch a conviction of ſin, enſue great ſtraits and humiliations of ſoul. When the poor ſinner ſees things as they are, an hoſt of ſins round about the ſoul, nay and within it, an hell flaſhing out of the guilt thereof, a defiling filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63874:41"/>in it, ſuch as makes him aſhamed to lift up his ſoul to God, and withall, ſuch bonds and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therein, as he cannot break by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then he becomes a <hi>Magor-miſſabib,</hi> terror round about, his heart more or leſs bleeds in tears, &amp; travels in pangs of conſcience, &amp; breaks under a damning Law, and droops and ſwoons away in fits of ſelf-confuſion and ſelf-deſparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at laſt is ready to cry out <q>Oh ſin! Oh wrath! what ſhall I do? whither go? <hi>can I fly from the Omnipreſent, grapple with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſtand before the holy One?</hi> all's impoſſible: can I endure an hell, abide a never-dying worm, or dwell with conſuming fire? 'tis intolerable. May my time be unravelled, my ſins undone, or my ſelf unborn, it cannot be. Oh! ſinful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn creature that I am, wo wo unto me for ever.</q> Such ſtraits as theſe make way for reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all the ſons of God come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the ſtraits of ſin, and paſs through a <hi>wilderneſs</hi> of wants and extremities towards the Land of promiſe; <hi>the valley of Achor,</hi> trouble and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for the accurſed thing, is a door of hope; husks and hunger make the Prodigal come to himſelf and his father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon this humiliation and ſtrait of ſoul, there enſues a deliberation, a ſtanding (as <hi>the King of Babylon</hi> did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.21.) at the parting of the way, to make a true enquiry. Lo! ſaith the afflicted ſoul in a ſelf-parley, here is the way of life, and there of death, this is the way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, and that's the way of time; <hi>If you live after the fleſh, you muſt dye, but if you mortifie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63874:42"/>the deeds of the body, you ſhall live, if you ſow unto the fleſh, you muſt reap corruption, if unto the ſpirit, life everlaſting.</hi> O my ſoul! be not deceived; God and ſin, Chriſt and Belial, heaven and hell, cannot mix together. Say then, O my ſoul, what wilt thou have? the meſs of pottage, or the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the pleaſures of ſin, or thoſe at Gods right hand, the worlds trinity of luſts, or communion with the bleſſed Trinity in heaven? Thus the ſoul ſits down and caſts up the coſt; ſin on and burn in hell for ever, turn to God and ſhine in eternal glory, ſpare thy luſts and damn thy ſoul, ſlay thy luſts and ſave it. Oh! what a fearful cheat is ſin? it proffers a profit or a pleaſure, and asks a ſoul; it holds out a moment or two, and would have eternity in pawn for it; it tickles the ſenſe, and ſtabs the conſcience; it courts and flatters <hi>like the ſtrange woman,</hi> and leads down to <hi>hell and death.</hi> Such deliberations as theſe make way for reſignation; an indeliberate reſignation is but a flaſh and away, but a deliberate one is fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After all this the holy ſpirit doth ſo far preſs in the holy light, as to work a denial of a mans ſelf and his luſts in ſome meaſure. I ſay, <hi>in ſome meaſure,</hi> for without ſome meaſure of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, a man will never reſign up himſelf to God and Chriſt. Thus our Saviour, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, Mat.</hi> 16.24. firſt deny himſelf, and then go to Chriſt: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden, Mat.</hi> 11.28. firſt be weary of ſin, and then go to Chriſt; <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63874:42"/>he that will follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt do as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> did, <hi>leave his nets,</hi> all the entangling luſts of his heart, and ſo follow him. Whileſt a man <hi>ſits at the receit of cuſtome,</hi> driving on a trade of ſin, he cannot follow him. Firſt, he muſt with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> riſe up from thence, and then he may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Alſo I ſay in ſome meaſure, for the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial before precious faith, muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſelf-denial after it: ſelf-denial before faith is wrought in us by the holy ſpirit, making impreſſions and darting in light into the heart in a tranſient way: ſelf-denial after faith is wrought in us by the holy ſpirit, dwelling in the heart by faith, and acting therein as an abiding principle of all grace. Before faith, it is in a far leſſer mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree, after faith it grows up to a full ſtature: before faith it doth in ſome ſort caſt off the ſoveraignty of ſin, the ſoul no longer chuſes to live under its dominion, but looking upon it as cruel bondage, caſts off its allegiance: after faith it ſtrikes at the very life of ſin, in the work of mortification. What is ſaid of the beaſts in <hi>Daniel, their dominion was taken away, and yet their lives were prolonged, Dan.</hi> 7.12. the ſame may be ſaid of ſin, firſt it loſes its crown and then its life. The holy ſpirit in the firſt meaſure of ſelf-denial, doth as it were dethrone ſin in order to reſignation; and in the after-meaſure thereof, it mortifies and nails it to the croſs, there to dye and expire. Now this meaſure of ſelf-denial, which precedes reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſtands in divers things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, There is a denial of a mans reaſon.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the candle of the Lord is not to be denied;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63874:43"/>but reaſon, as it is a falſe light, as it pleads for <hi>Baal,</hi> the lording luſt of the ſoul, as it plays the ſerpent, ſeducing from holy truths, as it ſows pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows under preſumptuous ſinning, as it laughs at holineſs and divine myſteries above its compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, is ſurely to be denied. We muſt <hi>become fools, that we may be wiſe,</hi> put out our lamp, that it may be lighted by the ſpirit, and crucifie our <hi>why's</hi> and <hi>wherefores,</hi> that we may believe the Goſpel. <hi>Abraham</hi> having Gods promiſe for a ſeed, <hi>conſidered not, Rom.</hi> 4.19. and <hi>ſtaggered not,</hi> or (as in the original) <hi>diſcerned not, v.</hi> 20. he did not play the critick upon the dead body and dead womb, he laid by his diſcretion, that he might give glory to God by believing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, There is a denial of a mans will.</hi> This is the forbidden fruit, and womb of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, unleſs this be renounced, there is no hope of reſignation; our own will is a thing of <hi>Belial,</hi> and unleſs ſubdued by grace, will not take Chriſt's yoke: it is an inward <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and unleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the divine <hi>ſpirit and brightneſs,</hi> will <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt it ſelf above the will of God. Saul</hi> muſt have a light from heaven, and a fall to the earth, &amp; a fit of trembling, or elſe he will not reſign, and ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Act.</hi> 9.6. the will muſt be un-ſelved, and the man become as a little child, without any will of his own, or elſe there can be no reſignation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, There is a denial of a mans carnal affections.</hi> Theſe are <hi>the camels which cannot go thorough the needles eye,</hi> the weights and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets which preſs down the ſoul from God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63874:43"/>theſe be caſt off, there can be no reſignation; our Saviour is poſitive in it, <hi>how can ye believe which receive honour one of another? Joh.</hi> 5.44. A ſoul breathed into vain-glorious air, or drowned in ſenſual pleaſures, or laden with the thick clay of the world, cannot reſign; he that will offer up himſelf to God, muſt leave the world behind his back, his affections muſt be gathered in from earth, and <hi>Angel-like,</hi> aſcend in the flame of faith; the vail of time muſt be put by, and an entry made upon eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, There is a denial of a mans own power.</hi> Proud perſons, <hi>puft up in their fleſhly mind,</hi> vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dream that their Reaſon can ſpan all myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and their Will teem out all graces, no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are too ſtrong for them, nor duties too weighty. Alaſs! theſe are ſo far from reſignation, that they are not come to illumination, through prodigious blindneſs they are <hi>ſtrong in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, rich in their poverty, free in their chains,</hi> and <hi>ſomething in their nothingneſs.</hi> And what ſhould they go to God for? as yet they are not ſo much as in the way thither; but let the man put off his falſe ornaments, and lay by his proud plumes, and ſenſibly feel <hi>a carnal mind,</hi> and <hi>a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Law,</hi> a <hi>weak heart,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong corruptions;</hi> let him groan and cry out of the blind eyes which cannot unſcale, the iron ſinewed Will which cannot bow, the falſe heart which cannot go true, and the fallen nature, which cannot reach ſo high as an holy thought. Let him be weak in his impotency, till God ſet up <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> in his heart; poor in his poverty, till he have a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63874:44"/>ſhare in Chriſts riches; a captive in his chains, till God break them off and bid him go free; and nothing in his nothingneſs, that creating grace may paſs upon him, and <hi>God be all in all.</hi> This is the way to reſignation, ſuch is Gods method to bring light out of darkneſs, perfect power in weakneſs, and call things that are not, as if they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, There is a denial of a mans own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Every man naturally would be a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifier, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. he would <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> or make to ſtand <hi>his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> though it be but a dead carcaſs, he would ſet it upon its legs; though but a breathleſs image, he would have it ſtand alone; and the reaſon is, becauſe he would be juſtified by ſomewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he would not go out for a righteouſneſs: But alaſs, all this while he doth not, cannot, reſign; thus the Apoſtle in that place, <hi>going about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſs, they ſubmitted not themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> A man, whileſt upon his own bottom, will not ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but take him up into <hi>Moriah,</hi> into <hi>the viſion of God,</hi> and ſhew him the purity of Gods nature, and the ſinfulneſs of his own; carry him to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and let him ſee the neceſſity of a perfect righteouſneſs, and the impoſſibility of an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one in himſelf; pluck away his fig-leaves of falſe righteouſneſs, and open his eyes upon his own nakedneſs and poverty: this is the true way to reſignation.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the ſecond thing in faith; what manner of belief of Scripture this is, and how in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63874:44"/>the conſequents of it the holy ſpirit ſtrikes in the holy light upon the heart, and by certain ſteps brings it to the very borders of reſignation: which is the third and laſt thing in faith now to be opened.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Of the third and laſt thing in Faith, an holy thorough dependant <hi>Self-reſignation</hi> to the terms of the Goſpel; What it is, to whom and to what it is made, and for what purpoſes: with the adjuncts and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE third and laſt thing in Precious Faith, is a dependant yielding or reſignation of the ſoul unto Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and through him unto God, according to his word. This is the <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> act of faith, as faith is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel. Touching it, I ſhall firſt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what this reſignation is;</hi> and then offer my reaſons, <hi>why the vitality and eſſential nature of Faith doth conſiſt therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I muſt explain what this reſignation is in general: It is no other then <hi>a ſurrender of the ſoul to God according to theterms of the Covenant.</hi> God hath chalked out in the word a method of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and man reſigns up his ſoul to God in his own way. God ſays to man, if ever thou art ſaved
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63874:45"/>it muſt be through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, his blood muſt waſh out thy ſins, his righteouſneſs muſt anſwer the Law for thee. Content, ſaith the ſoul, I reſign up my ſelf to the Mediator, I lean my ſelf upon his blood and righteouſneſs for pardon and acceptance with thee. Among <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelms</hi> interrogatories to be propoſed unto men lying, <hi>in extremis</hi> at the point of death, one which the Miniſter offers to the ſick man is, <hi>doeſt thou believe that thou canſt not be ſaved but by Chriſts death,</hi> unto which when the ſick man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>yea, I ſo believe,</hi> the Miniſter is appointed to ſpeak to him thus, <hi>Age, dum ſupereſt in te anima, in hâc ſolâ morte ſiduciam tuam conſtitue, in nullâ aliâ re ſiduciam babe, buic morti te totum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte, bâc ſolâ te totum contege, totum immiſee, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum involve; Whileſt there is any breath in thee, place all thy conſidence in his death, and in nothing elſe, commit thy whole ſelf to it, cover and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle, and involve thy whole ſelf in it;</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I have ſet down, becauſe it doth empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically expreſs this act of reſignation. God ſays further, my Chriſt muſt not, cannot, be divided, if he ſave thee as a Prieſt, he muſt teach thee as a Prophet, and rule over thee as a King, for I have made him all theſe. Content, ſaith the ſoul, his blood is not, cannot be ſpiritleſs; I give up my ſelf to his holy ſpirit to be taught and ruled: I deſire to ſay with <hi>Baldaſſar</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <hi>Veniat, veniat verbum Domini, &amp; ſubmitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus illi, ſexcenta ſi nobis eſſent colla; Let the word of the Lord Chriſt come,</hi> let it come teaching and ruling, <hi>and I deſire to ſubmit to it, even ſix hundred
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63874:45"/>necks, if he had ſo many.</hi> God ſays further, my Chriſt is a crucified one, and you cannot, muſt not divide him from the croſs. No ſaith the ſoul, I will take him croſs and all. I would fain ſay as the noble <hi>Ignatius, veniant crux, ignis, oſſium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractiones, modò Chriſtum habeam, let the croſs, and the fire, and the broken bones come, ſo I may but have Chriſt,</hi> I hope nothing ſhall ſeparate me from his love. God ſays again, through this Chriſt thou muſt in all thy wants caſt thy ſelf upon me for a ſupply. I cannot (ſaith the ſoul) bear up my own weight in this reſpect, I would fain lay all upon thee; my guilt upon thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, my unworthineſs upon thy free-grace, my folly upon thy wiſdom, and my weakneſs upon thy almighty power; if thou doeſt not help me, the barn-floor and wine-preſs of the creature cannot do it; if thou fail me, I am confounded and expect to be miſerable. Moreover ſays God, in all thy addreſſes unto me, thou muſt look to thy warrant, and ſee whether Scripture will bear thee out in it or not. The Scripture (ſaith the ſoul) is the Great Charter, above ſealed by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite veracity, and below by faith; this, this is the ſacred rule I deſire to go by in all my reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: After ſome ſuch manner as this doth the believing ſoul ſurrender up it ſelf. But for the more clear opening of this reſignation, I ſhall conſider three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Unto whom or what this reſignation is made?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For what things or purpoſes it is made?</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:63874:46"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What are the Adjuncts and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom or what this reſignation is made?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>it is made unto Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, unto God the whole ſacred Trinity, and unto the Word:</hi> unto Chriſt as the Mediator and grand medium of ſalvation; unto God as the Center and ultimate object of Faith; and unto the Word, as the warrant, rule, and way, in, by, and according to which faith muſt proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This reſignation is made to Chriſt as the Mediator and grand medium of ſalvation.</hi> I begin with this firſt, becauſe Faith cannot go to God immediately, but to the Mediator firſt, and ſo to God. Thus the Scripture ſaith, <hi>through him we have acceſs to the Father, Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>by him we come unto God, Heb.</hi> 7.25. and which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, <hi>by him we believe in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. If we will go to our heavenly Father, we muſt firſt put on our elder brothers robes, we muſt cloath our faith and reſignation in the reſignations of Chriſt, and ſo appear before God; we muſt put our faith into the hand of a Mediator, and from thence it will aſcend up before the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. Take away the Mediator, and God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming ſire, no ſaith, no prayer, can approach unto him: <hi>If the cloud of incenſe do not cover the Mercy-ſeat, Aaron will dye before it, Lev.</hi> 16.13. unleſs the Mediators merits had been as a cloud of incenſe about God, the ſinner, though in the loweſt poſture of reſignation, muſt have died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father of mercies. Firſt then, there is a reſignation unto Chriſt as the Mediator and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63874:46"/>grand medium of ſalvation: For the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, two things are conſiderable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is by Gods ordination ſealed to be a Mediator. <hi>There is one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. Chriſt, as God-man, ſtood up between an offended God, and offending man, and acts as a Mediator in all his offices: As a Prieſt he acts with God to pacifie his wrath, and purchaſe grace and glory for men; and as a Prophet and a King he acts with men, to declare unto them the Will of God, and rule over them by his ſpirit and word; Thus the <hi>livine days<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> lays his hand upon both, God above, and man below, to bring them together in a mutual reconciliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this reſignation to Chriſt as Mediator, is in a way congruous to all his offices: Look as God above ſealed him to be a Mediator by his ordination, ſo man below ſeals as it were the counter-part by his reſignation: The belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yields up himſelf to Chriſt as a Prieſt, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency on his merits and ſweet-ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. This in Scripture is called, <hi>ſaith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. he yields up himſelf to Chriſt as a Prophet, by an humble teachableneſs; this is called, <hi>a hearing of the Prophet, Act.</hi> 3.22. and he yields up himſelf to Chriſt as a King, by an holy ſubjection; and this is called, <hi>receiving Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, Col.</hi> 2.6. Thus this reſignation, as a key to the wards of the lock, ſuits and hits Chriſt in every office. What is merit in Chriſt, is fiducialneſs in faith; What is inſtruction in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63874:47"/>Chriſt, is docibleneſs in faith; What is roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty in Chriſt, is obedientialneſs in faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, This reſignation is made unto God, even the whole ſacred Trinity, as the center and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate object of faith,</hi> I ſay, <hi>the whole ſacred Trinity.</hi> For though Chriſt, as God-man, the Mediator, be only the grand medium, by and through which faith makes its approaches to God, yet Chriſt as God is not the ultimate object of faith; I ſay, <hi>the whole ſacred Trinity,</hi> as the center and ultimate object of faith: For nothing is or can be the formal reaſon or terminating object of faith, but the Deity or divine nature only; whoſe infinit excellency and perfection doth naturally merit the ſame; whoſe infallible truth, rich mercy, matchleſs power, and unſearchable wiſdom, calls for faith to come and repoſe in its boſom; there and there only can it ultimately reſt and keep Sabbath: this the Scripture expreſſes emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally by <hi>truſting in Jehovah, the rock of ages,</hi> and center of faith. Thus then it is, faith firſt goes to Chriſt the Mediator, and then in and through him it advances unto God. The Apoſtle is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in it, <hi>who by him do believe in God, that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Faith in Chriſts blood, is ſaith in the way, <hi>the new and living way, conſecrated through the vail of his fleſh;</hi> but faith in God, is faith in the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end and center. Moreover, that faith may arrive at him, he comes as it were out of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approachable light, and manifeſts himſelf in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; he lets down his veracity, grace, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63874:47"/>power, holineſs, and ſoveraignty, as ſo many beams of his glory for our faith to lean upon, and as it were to climb up by unto himſelf. <hi>They that know thy name will truſt in thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. the knowledge of Attributes is a ſtaff to our weak faith in its walk to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This reſignation is made unto the werd as the warrant, rule, and way, in, by, and according to which faith doth proceed. Theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that you might believe, Joh.</hi> 20.31. As for the choice bleſſings which faith waits for from God and Chriſt, the promiſes are the warrant. As for the obediential ſubjection to God and Chriſt, the commands are the rule. As for the teachings of the Spirit, the whole word is the way, in which believers looks for the ſame. If faith look up, the word is the perſpective; if it work, the word is the line and plummet; if it conſult, here's the oracle; if it weigh things, here's the ballance: Faith is never warrantleſs. There is tranſgreſſing without cauſe, but never believing. Faith reſigns to the Mediator, and through him to God, but the commiſſion for both is in the word.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the firſt thing, unto whom or what this reſignation is made. But to go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, For what things or purpoſes is it made?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>It is made for very great things and ends.</hi> In opening of which, I ſhall to each of them accommodate the former diſtinction of reſignation, as to the Mediator, as to God, and as to the Word. That the nature of this reſignation may the more fully appear, the precious things and ends for which it is made, are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:63874:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, The ſoul is reſigned to be inſtructed in all the ways of God.</hi> And this reſignation, that I may keep to the prae-appointed method, is made</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and as to him, firſt faith Diſciples the ſoul to him, and then yields it up to him to be taught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It Diſciples the ſoul to Chriſt; before faith a man is as a Wolf or a Lion for brutiſh untractableneſs; but after it, <hi>a little child may lead him,</hi> even the leaſt truth in the word, and he will not break from it: his ear is opened, and his mind in a readineſs for inſtruction. Now this Faith doth two ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It doth it by revealing the excellency of Chriſt as a Prophet. Oh! ſays faith, this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rabbie, <hi>the Angel of Gods face, the wonderful counſeliar,</hi> lying in his boſome and knowing all his ſecrets; <hi>his mouth is moſt ſweet,</hi> he ſpeaks ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-combs of grace, and breaths beams of light, and utters ſparkles of glory; nothing but myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and rectitudes and words of eternal life ever came from him, and (to make theſe come home to thee) he is an inward <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> one who can unlock thy ſecrets, and come into the midſt of thee, and there expreſs himſelf in words of life and power, and all the while his Majeſty ſhall not ſwallow thee up. He ſpeaks through an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature and vail of fleſh, in rare condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and compaſſion towards thy weakneſs. Whileſt faith is in the high praiſes of this great Prophet, the heart cannot chuſe but be upon the wheels ready to run to him, and ſay, <hi>ſpeak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:63874:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It doth it by humbling and ſoftning the heart. Before faith a man is in the ruff of pride, and there's no ſpeaking to him; his heart is as a ſtone or Adamant, and beats off holy truths: but after it, the man becomes as a little child, and Chriſt may ſay any thing to him, <hi>his ſtony heart is turned into fleſh,</hi> and ſo made ready for God to be manifeſted in it. Faith doth ſo meeken the heart, that it will ſit down at Chriſts feet, and hear him, even in his hardeſt Lectures. Let Chriſt talk of racks, and bloody perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Goſpel, and the believer will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to get up the croſs on his back. Let Chriſt preach of high and tranſcendent myſteries, ſuch as reaſon cannot fathom, and the believer will ſubſcribe in ſilence, what ever reaſon mutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith having diſcipled the ſoul, yields it up to Chriſt to be taught: And becauſe now he doth not teach in perſon, as once in the days of his fleſh, faith yields up the ſoul to him to be taught by his ſpirit. The diſcipled believer loves to ſtand as <hi>Adam, in the wind of the day,</hi> in the gales of the holy ſpirit. And this will appear in two-things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Faith waits upon the Spirit in the Means, and when the ſpirit comes in holy motions, it welcomes him into the ſoul. Faith waits upon the Spirit in the Means, there it cries out, as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> at <hi>Jordan, where is the God of Elijah?</hi> here's the mantle, but where's the God? here are the Scriptures, but where's the Spirit that endited them, to make holy impreſſions and ſeal divine
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63874:49"/>truths upon the heart? here are the ordinances, but oh! for the moving of the waters, <hi>awake O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon the garden that the ſpices may flow out.</hi> And when the ſpirit comes in holy motions, faith opens the everlaſting doors, and welcoms him in, as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, <hi>come in thou bleſſed of the Lord;</hi> ſtand not only without in the Scripture-letter, come in, <hi>thou that comeſt in the name of the Lord.</hi> Take the throne of my heart, and bid the world go down and ſit at thy footſtool. Take the keys of the ſoul, and unlock every faculty, ſet up thy lamps in every dark corner, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the accurſed things there: Speak, O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Rabbi, ſpeak in words of life and power, and ſhew me the path of life and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith is very chary and loth to loſe the teaching ſpirit. Like the Spouſe in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, <hi>it holds him and and will not let him go, Cant.</hi> 3.4. This is to the believer as the apple of his eye, he would not have a duſt of earth fall into to leſt it grieve and weep out ſome of the holy light, and as the fire in the Temple, it muſt not go out, if there be but a live coal or ſingle ſpark it muſt be brown up into a flame. Holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are very precious to the believer, as it were beams of heaven, better in Faiths account then the great Sun which quickens the animal world; and like ſo many good Angels ſent from God to give the ſoul a viſit: rather then theſe ſhould be violated and abuſed, faith will offer all its world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts, as <hi>Lot</hi> his daughters, to be defloured.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63874:49"/>If the holy ſpirit depart, faith writes ſcabbed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all other things, and the believer becomes as a dead man, unable to breath in prayer, or walk in holineſs, or live or have a being in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al world. The Sun is down, and it is night with him; the dew is off, and his fleece dry; the gales are wanting, and he is at a ſtand in his voyage to heaven. Thus faith yields up the ſoul to be taught by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, In and through Chriſt the Mediator, faith yields up the ſoul to God to be taught by the ſpirit.</hi> I ſay, <hi>in and through Chriſt the Mediator:</hi> Without a Mediator God will not ſpeak to a ſinful creature, unleſs out of the fire, in words of wrath, like thoſe at the laſt day, <hi>Go, thou curſed one.</hi> If he ſpeak and commune with us in words of peace and ſalvation, it muſt be from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat, that is, through Chriſt, who is called Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>propitiatory, Rom.</hi> 3.25. Hence Chriſt is called <hi>the wiſdom of God,</hi> becauſe through him that wiſdom doth manifeſt it ſelf; and as God ſpeaks, ſo faith hears and reſigns, both are in and through the Mediator. I ſay, in and through the Mediator, faith yields up the ſoul to God to be taught by the ſpirit, the very ſame teaching ſpirit; as it was procured by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, ſo it is given out by God. Therefore faith, for the teaching thereof, reſigns up the ſoul as to the Mediator the procurer, ſo to God the donor of it: And in this reſignation faith climbs up to him by that noble Attribute of his infinite wiſdom. Are there tranſcendent myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Scripture? Faith will reſign and cry out
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63874:50"/>with <hi>Zophar, Oh! that God would ſpeak and ſhew me the ſecrets of wiſdom.</hi> Whileſt the Scripture is in its hands, it ſighs and looks up for the key to unlock and ſhew forth this and that truth in its ſpiritual glory, or at leaſt in ſome ſuch beams of it as it is capable of; the Original Languages will not ſerve its turn, without the Original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; nor the Learned Commentators, without the great Interpreter: that only wiſe God who endited the Scripture, can illuſtrate the heart; and whileſt the believer reads the one, he waits for the other. Is there a practical caſe dubious and perplexed, like an intricate Labyrinth or way-leſs wilderneſs? and when the believer goes about to put all circumſtances into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, doth he tremble and demurr like <hi>Origen</hi> at the Idol-incenſe, and cannot be ſatisfied? In ſuch a caſe Faith runs, and <hi>Eſra</hi>-like hangs upon God for a right way; <hi>the All-wiſe can make a way in the wilderneſs, and guide thee with his eye,</hi> ſaith Faith: one caſt or glance from his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will diſintricate thy doubts, and make thy way plain before thee. Doth the outward world grow ſtormy and tempeſtuous? is the sky of the times overclouded with troubles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? faith ſtands in the poſture of <hi>Jehoſhaphat, we know not what to do, but our eyes are upon thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. we know not, but thou knoweſt how to deliver; there is nothing but confuſion below, but all is clear and ſerene in thy wiſe counſels; there is no one way or method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance in our reaſon, but there are inſinite mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ways and methods with thee. Such a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63874:50"/>faith as this made <hi>Luther</hi> in the troubles of the Church cry out, <hi>That it was far otherwiſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in heaven, then at Norimberg;</hi> and in the blackeſt tempeſt inſpirits the believer to do, as the Mariners in the <hi>Acts, caſt anchor, and wiſh for the day,</hi> roll himſelf on the wiſe God, and wait for the dawning of comfort from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Faith yields up the ſoul for inſtruction unto the word.</hi> And here are three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Faith reſigns to the word, as a warrant for both the former reſignations. If you ask a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever why he preſumes ſo far, as to go to Chriſt and God for the teachings of the ſpirit, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will be this; I find in the word divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>that we ſhall be taught of God, that the ſpirit ſhall lead us into all truth, that there is an holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing dropping from Chriſt, which teacheth all things.</hi> And all theſe promiſes are very true, the counterpanes of Gods heart, and exactly congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the grace there; God ſpeaks in them, and without complement he ſpeaks as he means, therefore I reſign up my ſoul unto Chriſt and God for inſtruction; <hi>teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed thy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.66. where by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ſome Divines underſtand all the word, including in it Promiſes as well as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: however the believer hath a warrant to pray, <hi>teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed thy promiſes of inſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith reſigns to the word, as a rich mine and treaſury of knowledge, there are preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63874:51"/>ous myſteries, ſuch as have the divine wiſdom flowing in them. Them <hi>Hungarians</hi> have a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that their golden Crown dropt down from heaven; to be ſure the myſteries in Scripture did ſo, they are pure Revelations, come down from God to be as golden Crowns on the head of Faith. The window of the Ark was (as ſome Rabbins ſay) a pretious ſtone, which gave light to all the creatures; and indeed the Original, which we tranſlate <hi>window, Gen.</hi> 6.16. imports a ſplendor or clear light. Underſtanding is our window, but the Scripture myſteries make it a window of pearl. Humane learning is but pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted glaſs, but theſe make <hi>windows of agates,</hi> ſuch as are in the taught of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.12, 13. Theſe are riches of underſtanding, pearls and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual rubies, fit to be laid up in the very middle and Center of the heart. There the holy precepts and precious promiſes, beauties of holineſs and glories of grace lye open to the embraces of Faith. There the inviſible God, whoſe dwelling is in light unapproachable, and whoſe pure glory our eyes cannot look on, may be ſeen in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex, in the Scripture image and condeſcenſion. In a word, ſo rich are the veins of knowledge there, that faith, as a day-labourer, is ever digging therein, to draw out a ſtock of holy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith reſigns to the word, as the only way in which a man may be taught of God: All men are ambitïous of ſo grand a priviledge. The very Gentiles in the puddle of their filthy Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, thought themſelves taught of God in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63874:51"/>their Oracles. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> think themſelves more ſure of it in their <hi>Alcoran, at which</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the devils themſelves rejoyced, and turned to God;</hi> no queſtion they rejoyed at ſuch a bundle of lies and blaſphemies, but that they turned to God is a wild deluſion. The <hi>Jews</hi> boaſt themſelves no leſs in their Oral Law, which (ſay they) God delivered over to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to the Elders, and they to the Prophets, and they to the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> and they at laſt to writing in the <hi>Talmud;</hi> calling it, <hi>lux illa magna,</hi> that great light, which yet is but a dark labyrinth of errors and horrible falſities. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> run to their traditions and unwritten verities as Divine, and ſo bring in a load of fopperies and vain ſuperſtitions. The <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> cry up the ſpirit in an extra-ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way, and ſo turn aſide from the main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion. In ſuch falſe ways do men loſe themſelves and the Divine teaching, whileſt the believer knows where to ſind it, even in the Scriptures; in reading them, he ſits at Chriſts feet, and every where looks for <hi>Maſchil,</hi> inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God. In them is the Oracle, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> by which God anſwers him; here he opens his heart, and ſpreads abroad all his ſails to take in the gales of the holy ſpirit, and <hi>be filled in all the will of God, Col.</hi> 4.12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, filled with it as the ſails are with the wind; <hi>Whileſt the Eunuch was reading the Prophet Eſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the ſpirit joined Philip to his chariot, Act.</hi> 8.29. Whileſt the believer hath his being in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ſpirit joyns himſelf to his heart, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63874:52"/>by the infuſion of holy light, makes him go on rejoycing in the way of knowledge. Here and only here doth he wait to be taught of God; ſuch is and, ſince the ſealing up of the Canon, ever hath been, the way of knowledge. And what of extraordinary diſpenſation hath been ſince, hath either directly turned men to their Bibles,<note place="margin">Confeſſ. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi> Melch. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tà Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii.</note> as the voice to St. <hi>Auſtin, tolle, lege, tolle, lege,</hi> pointing him to the Scripture; or elſe hath quoted or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ſome Scripture-truth. Thus when it was objected to <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> that the word [<hi>eſt</hi>] in Scripture-parables may be taken for [<hi>ſignificat</hi>] but not <hi>in verbis coenae,</hi> in the Sacramental phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and his thoughts were buſie about it, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was ſuggeſted to him in a dream, a moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> telling him, <hi>Quin ignare, reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ei, quod in Exodo legitur, eſt enim phaſe, hoc eſt, tranſitus Domini,</hi> in which there is nothing extra-ſcriptural, but a Scripture-inſtance given for that which before was a Scripture-truth; the Scripture is the only place where we can look for Divine teaching. To conclude, that of the Father is remarkable, <hi>qui ſacrâ non utitur Scripturâ, ſed aſcendit aliunde, non conceſſâ viâ, fur eſt, he that goes not into knowledge by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a thief,</hi> the believer keeps the divine road.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the firſt thing, reſignation for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the ways of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Faith reſigns up the ſoul to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and juſtiſied before God;</hi> unto juſtification and pardon there are three things prae-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:63874:52"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> An act of free grace in God. All men are naturally ſinners, and as ſuch, Gods holineſs cannot but hate them, Gods juſtice cannot but puniſh them; wherefore free-grace ſtepped in and found out a way, how God, who cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the ungodlineſs, might yet <hi>juſtifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. and that in a way of compliance both with his holineſs and juſtice; with his holineſs, providing a perfect righteouſneſs; and with his juſtice, providing a perfect ſatisfaction for them in a ſurety: hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we are juſtified freely by his grace, Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Freely, by his grace;</hi> he uſes two words, the more plainly and emphatically to decipher out to us the pure fountain of love and grace, out of which pardon and juſtification iſſue forth to poor ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There muſt be a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fully anſwering the holy Law. God cannot deny himſelf, he cannot deny his holineſs, ſo as to juſtifie us without a righteouſneſs, therefore there muſt be one; he cannot deny his truth, ſo as to account that a righteouſneſs which is none, therefore it muſt be perfect, fully anſwering the Law; <hi>all-fair without any ſpot in it,</hi> all-pure without any mixture in it, all-perfect without and defect in it, ſuch a thing as is not to be found in any meer man. The Jews (as it ſeems by <hi>Joſephus</hi>) thought a meer outward righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs enough; but alaſs, what is this without a pure heart? The Popiſh Doctors look upon inherent graces as our very righteouſneſs in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: indeed theſe (becauſe the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63874:53"/>is <hi>à meliore parte</hi>) denominate men righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but they are but inchoate and imperfect, and therefore are ſhort of that perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute righteouſneſs requiſite to juſtification. They denominate men righteous, but they do it but in their own weak degree, and not in full proportion to the holy Law; <hi>a gracious man is not all grace,</hi> there is fleſh as well as ſpirit, droſs as well as gold, water as well as wine in him; his mind is not all Light his will is not all love, his affections are not all harmony; what of grace he hath is but in part, and if this be his righteouſneſs, he can be juſtified but in part, or rather not at all. Neither can our good works, no not thoſe which flow from grace, ever be our righteouſneſs in juſtification. Thoſe are good as they flow from the pure fountain of the ſpirit, but as they proceed from us (in whom there is much of the old <hi>Adara</hi>) they ſmell of the cask and ſoil in the channel, and contract a great deal of droſs from the indwelling ſin: Hence they are ſo far from juſtifying us, that they themſelves need a juſtification. Hence holy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prays that his good works may be remembred, with a <hi>ſpare me O Lord, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy, Neh,</hi> 13.22. Neither will it ſuffice to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if our good works are more then our evil. The Papiſts fable that <hi>Henry the ſecond Emperour</hi> was weighed in the ballance, to ſee whether he were worthy of heaven or hell; his good works were put into one ſcale, his evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, and theſe were like to out weigh and ſink him to hell, but that St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> put
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63874:53"/>in the Chalice by the Emperour given him, and ſo made the ſcale of good works preponderate. O vain tale! nothing weighs with God in the point of juſtification but a compleat rightcouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that can no where be found but in Chriſt alone; he and he only fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and therefore he is called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There muſt be an expiation of ſin, or elſe there can be no juſtification. The very Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles themſelves, ſtung with the conſcience of ſin and vengeance, had their expiatory and luſtrato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifices. The antient lews, being Gods people, had their offerings and ſacrifices for ſin, to make an Atonement according to the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law. The latter Jews, though they reject the ſacrifice of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> yet that they might not be wholly without an expiation, offer a cock for ſin, becauſe the word [<hi>Gebher</hi>] in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a <hi>man,</hi> and in the <hi>Talmud</hi> a <hi>cock;</hi> hence they ſay, <hi>Gebher,</hi> that is, <hi>the man ſinneth,</hi> and <hi>Gebher,</hi> that is, <hi>the cock ſuffereth.</hi> If the Prophet <hi>Iſaias</hi> in the 53. chapter, had uſed the word (<hi>Gebher</hi>) the Rabbins (ſaith a Learned man) would have turned the man into a cock; but there it is not <hi>Gebher,</hi> but <hi>Iſh, a man of ſorrows:</hi> But theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations not availing, God hath provided an expiation in the death of his ſon. <hi>Without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood there is no remiſſion,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. and becauſe creature-blood could not do it, the blood of God was ſhed to redeem us
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63874:54"/>from ſin; Jeſus Chriſt, who is God-man, <hi>offered up himſelf through the eternal ſpirit, to purge our conſciences from dead works:</hi> he paid the utmoſt farthing to Divine juſtice, and hath left nothing at all to pay for the believing finner. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſacrifices were no expiations at all, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>ſacrifices to devils and not to God;</hi> nay, in their own account they did not expiate in all caſes. Hence when the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was haunted with the innocent blood he had ſhed, the <hi>Gentile Flamius</hi> could tell him of no expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the blood of Chriſt is a true and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal expiation, <hi>cleanſing from ſin and all ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. The Levitical ſacrifices, though of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, were but types and ſhadows, <hi>making nothing perfect.</hi> But a crucified Chriſt is the ſum and ſubſtance of them, really atoning what thoſe did but typically. <hi>The Rabbinical cock</hi> is a ſtrange vanity, in which we may ſtand and wonder at the Jewiſh blindneſs; but what their vain <hi>Gebher</hi> could not do, that our <hi>Iſh the man of ſorrows, upon whom all our iniquities met,</hi> hath done indeed: <hi>he was wounded for our iniquities, his ſoul was an offering for ſin, his life a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I ſay the ſoul by Faith doth reſign up it ſelf for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and juſtification. And, that I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my firſt method, this reſignation is made</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:63874:54"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, To Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator.</hi> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, conſcious to his own ſpiritual poverty, doth as the poor man in the <hi>Pſalm, commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> or as the Original is, <hi>leave himſelf on the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 10.14. In ſtead of a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he hath raggs of weakneſs and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he leaves himſelf upon the perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, as a thing fully anſwering every jot and tittle of the Law. Indeed ſome great Rabbies cry out upon <hi>imputative righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> as a thing impoſſible, calling it <hi>putative,</hi> a meer imagination, <hi>Luthers ſpectrum,</hi> the pleaſing dream of ſimple Chriſtians; but in ſober ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the dream is on their own ſide. If imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive righteouſneſs be impoſſible, how can we ſtand before the righteous Law, dooming and curſing the leaſt defect or non-continuance in all things? Imputative righteouſneſs is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblé, and inherent is imperfect, and how can we ſtand? if we ſtand, <hi>the righteouſneſs of God muſt be upon us, Rom.</hi> 3.22. Chriſt muſt be <hi>the end of the Law for righteouſneſs unto us, Rom.</hi> 10.4. and how can this be without an imputation? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if imputed righteouſneſs be impoſſible, what is imputed ſin? If that be ſo too, how was Chriſt made <hi>ſin, or an offering for it?</hi> to what purpoſe was his blood and ſufferings? what becomes of redemption, &amp; all the train of bleſſings waiting thereon? what to thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Reaſon is but a fancy, a <hi>ſpectrum</hi> or dream, that to the believer is the very thing <hi>he would be found in before God, Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Apollodorus</hi> offer'd <hi>Socrates</hi> a pretious garment to dye in. <hi>Imputed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63874:55"/>righteouſneſs</hi> is the bleſſed robe which the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would live, and dye, and riſe in, unto the judgment-ſeat at the laſt day. Upon this he will venture his ſoul, againſt all the demands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience in the Law. Moreover, inſtead of ſatisfying Juſtice for his debts, he hath juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own to pay, but he leaves himſelf upon the blood and rich merits of Chriſt; his ſins are maſſie burdens, too weighty for all the Angels in heaven to ſtand under, but he unloads all upon <hi>the Lamb of God, who bore away the ſin of the world:</hi> his debts to God amount to a vaſt ſum, but he ventures upon <hi>the great ſurety, who paid the utmoſt farthing,</hi> and had a total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in his reſurrection, and now is in heaven to ſee the ſcores croſſed in Gods book, and the bonds of guilt cancelled and thrown down into conſcience. If the avenging Law purſue him, he ſlies to Chriſt as a City of refuge, and there hides himſelf <hi>in the clefts of the rock,</hi> in the bleeding wounds of his Redeemer: here is faiths anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, here he ventures his ſoul againſt all the curſes of the Law. Deny himſelf to be a ſinner, that he cannot, for his conſcience is a thouſand witneſſes: oppoſe the curſing Law, that he dares not, for it is backed by an infinite juſtice; but he ventures all upon the merit and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt: though in the night of deſertion he may lye in a piteous condition, as <hi>the Levites Concubine,</hi> forced, and as it were dead with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal terrors; yet ſtill his hand like hers, will be <hi>upon the threſhold, upon Chriſt the door of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> till free-grace dawn and break in upon him:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63874:55"/>without this reſignation the ſoul can have no peace. <hi>Gardiner</hi> himſelf, being ready to dye, was willing to hear of a juſtification in the blood of Chriſt, nothing elſe could expiate the guilt of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, In and through the Mediator, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation is made unto God; It is God that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</hi> God as ſupream Law-giver; the believer wraps up himſelf in the blood and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and ſo yields up himſelf unto God to be pardoned and juſtified. And in this reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the great attribute he leans on, is <hi>Gods grace:</hi> God is gracious, nay he hath <hi>riches of grace,</hi> ſuch as no unworthineſs of ours can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt; he hath <hi>glory of grace,</hi> ſuch as no ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can eclipſe; he can <hi>abundantly pardon,</hi> or as it is in the Original, <hi>multiply to pardon, Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. His grace can multiply pardons, as his power can creatures. Here is the beautiful gate, where the believer lies for an alms of pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: here he ventures himſelf upon God, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants, I hear that the God of heaven is a merciful God, I will put on my ropes and ſack-cloth, and away to him, it may be I may catch a word of grace from him, and live for ever; or arguing like <hi>the poor Lepers,</hi> if I ſit here in my ſins, I dye eternally; if it go unto the world, there is a famine of gace, let me fall into the arms of a good God, if he kill me, I thall bat dye, but if he ſave me, I ſhall live for ever; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a manner doth he caſt himſelf upon mercy. This act of faith is very precious, it touches God as it were in his bowels, and ſets
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63874:56"/>them a ſounding and melting into diſtillations of ſavour. As ſoon as the prodigal ſon returned and caſt himſelf on his fathers mercy, <hi>his father runs and kiſſes him; and the ring, and the beſt robe, and the ſatted calf, are all little enough for him, Luke</hi> 15. And as it is very <hi>pretious,</hi> ſo it is very <hi>ſafe.</hi>

Ask him again, why he reſigns to God for it, his anſwer will be, I find in the word that God is decy phered in bleſſed titles, as <hi>gracious, merciful, abundant in goodneſs, and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;</hi> and that the grace in his heart ſlows down to us in promiſes of pardon, <hi>blotting out iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and caſting ſin behind his back into the depth of the ſea,</hi> therefore I reſign.

               <p>Thus far of the ſecond thing, reſignation for pardon and juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Faith reſigns up the ſoul to be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Sanctification ſtands in two things, <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſin,</hi> and <hi>vivification of the ſoul,</hi> and for both theſe faith yields up the ſoul. And to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the promiſed order;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This reſignation is made to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator.</hi> And firſt touching <hi>Mortification,</hi> the believer yields his ſoul to Chriſt in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He yields up his ſoul to Chriſt as <hi>the grand ſamplar of mortification.</hi> What Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his pure fleſh by way of expiation, that muſt we ſuffer in our corrupt fleſh by way of mortification. His body was nailed to the croſs till the ſoul ſeparated from it; &amp; the body of ſin muſt be ſo nailed, till the ſoul, the will, and love, and delight of ſin depart. He was free in laying down his life and blood, and ſo muſt we be in laying down the life and blood of <hi>the old Adam:</hi> 'Tis true, the fleſh relucts and ſays, as Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, <hi>Oh! let this cup. paſs from me, but the ſpirit is willing,</hi> and cries out, <hi>Father, thy w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>a natural one.</hi> If it dye alone or of it ſelf, it is no ſacrifice, it muſt be cropt in the flower, and ſtabbed at the heart, and dye of its wounds; the violence done to God and Chriſt and the Spirit muſt be upon it, till it give up the ghoſt. Chriſt died <hi>a tormenting death,</hi> in pains and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, and we muſt dye ſo to ſin, we muſt <hi>ſuffer in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. bleeding under ſin, and being ſorrowful to the death of it. Chriſt died a <hi>lingring death,</hi> and ſo doth ſin, it doth not dye all at once, but languiſhes by little and little; the believer <hi>dies daily to ſin.</hi> The <hi>Coloſſians were dead C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l.</hi> 3.3. and yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>mortiſie your members, v.</hi> 8. Mortification muſt be upon mortification, becauſe ſin is long a dying: the genius of faith is, to have ſin crucified as Chriſt was, <hi>following his ſteps,</hi> as much as may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, He yields up his ſoul to Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe of mortification.</hi> Chriſts death merited ſins; hence faith glories in the croſs of Chriſt, as in that whereby <hi>the world is crucified to the believer, and he to the world, Gal.</hi> 6.14. there it would hang up every luſt as an accurſed thing. Faith lies at the bleeding wounds of Chriſt, watching for the breathings of that <hi>ſpirit, which can mortiſie the deeds of the body,</hi> waiting for that <hi>mind of Chriſt</hi> which can make us <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the fieſh,</hi> that we may ceaſe from ſin. Chriſt was crucified, and the believer would have the old man crucified together, he would dye with him as the graft doth with the ſtock. There is a Popiſh fable, that the angry <hi>Adriatick Sea</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63874:58"/>was becalmed by one of the nails of Chriſts croſs caſt into it; the moral is true: the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſea of luſt in our heart cannot be ſubdued but by the application of Chriſt death; the winds and waves there obey no other voice but that of Chriſt crucified, <hi>he yields up his ſoul to Chriſt as the royal worker of mortification.</hi> When he ſees his luſts as ſo many rebels riſing up in arrns, he flies to his ſoveraign Chriſt for a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſubdue them: the high things and ſtrong holds appearing in his underſtanding, make him cry out, Treaſon, Treaſon, <hi>the Jebuſite is in the tower of David;</hi> the fleſhly wiſdom hath got into the underſtanding, O thou wiſdom of God captivate and caſt it down. The Pagan luſts and Gentile-wills ſhewing themſelves in the heart, force him to break forth like the <hi>Pſalmiſt, O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance, thy temple they have deſiled, caſt them out O thou mighty Saviour, that my ſoul may be a ſanctuary for thy ſelf.</hi> When the battel is ſet before and behind, corruptions ſurrounding and encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, his eyes are upon his Lord <hi>ſitting above at the right hand of power, till his enemies be made his footſtool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the believer yields up his foul to Chriſt for <hi>mortification of ſin,</hi> ſo alſo for <hi>viviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſoul.</hi> And this in the very ſame reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He yields up his ſoul to Chriſt as <hi>the grand pattern of viviſication;</hi> the parallel is the Apoſtles own, <hi>Like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63874:59"/>ſhould walk in newneſs of life, Rom.</hi> 6.4. Look what was done in the fleſh of Chriſt in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal reſurrection, that is done in the ſpirits of Chriſtians in the ſpiritual reſurrection: there the ſtone was rolled away from the ſepulchre, here from the heart; there the fleſh of Chriſt was raiſed up by an Almighty power, called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the glory of the Father;</hi> here the ſoul of the believer is raiſed up by the ſame power, as appears <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. there after the corporceal reſurrection, Chriſt appeared in humane lineaments; here after the ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, the Chriſtian appears in divine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the genius of faith is to aſſimilate the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to Chriſt riſen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He yields up his ſoul to Chriſt as <hi>the meritorious cauſe of viviſication.</hi> Chriſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all graces for us, ſaith doth not dare to go immediately to God, no not for holineſs it ſelf, but it goes and ſucks at the breaſts of Chriſts humanity, well knowing that all graces are from the ſpirit, and the way of the ſpirit is by the blood, as <hi>Tagmon</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Magdenburg</hi> took the laſt breath of his dying Maſter <hi>Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang</hi> by applying mouth to mouth; ſo faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies its mouth as it were to the wounds of a dying Chriſt, from thence to receive the ſpirit of all grace; that love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs, temperance, as ſo many rivers of living water, may flow in the heart, to make glad the habitation of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that the holy ſpirit may be as it were the ſoul of the ſoul, breathing in the believers pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63874:59"/>and ſhining on his Bible, and melting in his charity, and impowering in his infirmity, and honey-dropping in his converſes, and being a <hi>Shechinah, a preſence and a glory</hi> in all his ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He yields up his ſoul to Chriſt as <hi>the Royal Donor of all quickning graces.</hi> Chriſt as a Prieſt merited all graces, but as a King he gives them out unto us, <hi>him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Act.</hi> 5.31. and ſo to give all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A melting heart is but a word of power from him at Gods right hand, an heavenly heart but a touch from him ſitting in heaven, every piece of holineſs is a beam of glory from him; meekneſs, and mercy, and obedience, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are as ſo many pearls dropping from his crown; all the ſheddings of the holy ſpirit ſlow from him who is exalted above, <hi>he aſcended up that he might fill all things, Eph.</hi> 4.10. that is, all the ſpiritual world of believers with grace. Faith therefore looks up for the ſweet illapſes of the ſpirit, and waits for graces as ſo many gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den apples dropping down from that tree of life which ſtands in the upper Paradiſe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, In and through the Mediator this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation is made unto God, it is God that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth.</hi> God as the ſupream fountain of grace; and in this reſignation faith climbs up to him partly by the Attribute of free-grace, <hi>caſt thy burden upon the Lord,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. or as the Original imports, <hi>omnia donabilia
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63874:60"/>tua, all that thou wouldeſt have given thee,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy want be, mortifying grace, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace, faith hath an art to caſt and unload all upon free-grace: there being a famine of grace in lapſed nature, faith brings out the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty veſſel, the ſoul void of ſelf-worthineſs, and ſets it under one ordinance or other, waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God till he rain down righteouſneſs upon the ſoul. This is <hi>the rain of liberalities,</hi> as the Original is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.9. this faith waits for <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money or price of its own,</hi> becauſe <hi>God is love,</hi> and grace free, and partly by the Attribute of Almighty power: ſin is ſtrong, but not infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the Almighty, <hi>who ſubdues all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> can eaſily ſubdue it. The heart is a dead womb, and not able to teem out the leaſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of grace, but the Almighty can <hi>quicken the dead,</hi> and raiſe up a divine ſeed therein. The fingers which made an Heaven and an Earth, can make a new heart and a new ſpirit: Faith takes hold on the power of God, for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſanctification in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This reſignation is made to the word,</hi> and that upon a double account. It is made to the word <hi>as the warrant of both the former reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> and made to the word <hi>as the engine in Gods hand for the working of ſanctification;</hi> it is made to the word <hi>as the warrant of both the former reſignations.</hi> The word is full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of mortifying and quickning grace, and theſe promiſes ſtream out to us from the pure fountain of free-grace, through the bleeding wounds of the Mediator, and are all <hi>Yea and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63874:60"/>Amen.</hi> Hence faith reſigns to God and Chriſt for all ſanctifying grace. It is alſo made to the word <hi>as the engine in Gods hand for the working of ſanctification.</hi> The word is a mighty weapon, able through Gods power to caſt down the heights and ſtrong holds of ſin; and an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſeed, able through Gods grace to quicken the heart, and ſpring up into the new-creature. Faith therefore reſigns to it, that the heart may be ſanctified through the truth.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the third thing, reſignation for ſanctification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Faith reſigns up the ſoul to be ruled as to its actings,</hi> I ſay, <hi>as to its actings.</hi> That I may clearly diſtinguiſh it from the but now mentioned ſanctification, which conſiſts in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles of grace. And ſtill to preſs in my old ſteps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This reſignation is made to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator.</hi> Faith tranſlates the ſoul into the kingdom of Chriſt, and loves to live no where elſe; the world in its eyes is but a houſe of bondage, but it loves to live in Chriſts domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Where holineſs is, there's <hi>the King of Saints,</hi> where meekneſs and patience, there's <hi>the throne of the Lamb;</hi> where righteouſneſs, there's <hi>his Scepter;</hi> where Gods will prevaileth, there <hi>he ſits in Power and Majeſty;</hi> at the laſt day ſenſe will diſcover this great King <hi>Jeſus coming in the clouds, in power and glory.</hi> But faith ſees him here coming in ſtate in every holy command, and riding as it were on the wings of the wind in every motion of the holy ſpirit. The poſture
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63874:61"/>of faith herein is like that of the <hi>Iſraelies,</hi> when the pillar of cloud and fire went before them, then they journied, otherwiſe they ſtaid in their place; when the ſpirit and word of Chriſt goes before the believer, faith follows after, elſe it will not ſtir a foot out of its place; it is really in the believers heart, to be ruled by Chriſt in all things. Take him in holy ordinances, theſe, ſaith faith, are the throne of Chriſt here below, in theſe he fits at the right hand of power; here the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever waits to ſee the power and the glory, as the man with the withered hand, in ſtretching it forth, waited for a power to reſtore it, and as the blind man in his going and waſhing in <hi>Siloam,</hi> waited for a power to recover his ſight: ſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in every ordinance waits for the power of Chriſt, if he break the rocky heart, &amp; melt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the divine will, the believer cries out <hi>the Lord reigneth;</hi> here is <hi>the day of power</hi> indeed. Take him in the works of his calling, and there he is ruled by Chriſt; one would think the ſervant were only toiling and drudging in his ſervile employments, but if he be a believer, he is <hi>ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord Chriſt, Col.</hi> 3.24. and by a divine praerogative above other mens, his deeds are <hi>wrought in God:</hi> ſuch was the poſture of pious <hi>Muſculus</hi> in the town-ditch, as well as in the Pulpit. Faith is ſuch an engine as brings down the kingdom of Chriſt (though not of this world) into the meaneſt trades, the believer acting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as <hi>Peter</hi> let down his net, at the command of Chriſt, and therein, as in his calling, abiding with God, which is more then the unbeliever
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63874:61"/>doth under divine ordinances: nay, take him even in natural actions, the believer (when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) cats, and drinks, and ſees, and hears, and ſpeaks, and ſleeps, and wakes, and walks after another rate then other men, doing all <hi>under the Law of Chriſt;</hi> that's a knife at his throat, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to his eyes, a ſtopper to his cars, a bridle on his lips, when he ſleepeth, that keeps him, when he waketh, that talks with him, when he walketh, that leads him; the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is not <hi>meat or drink</hi> or any ſuch thing, is by faith brought down into all theſe. The genius of faith is to be ruled by Chriſt in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, This reſignation in and through the Mediator, is made to God,</hi> I ſay, <hi>in and through the Mediator;</hi> becauſe without him, we can expect to be ruled by God in no other way then by the iron rod of his power and juſtice, daſhing us in pieces to all eternity; but in and through him, the believer may and doth yield up himſelf to God to be ruled. And here he makes uſe of two Attributes, <hi>Gods ſoveraignty,</hi> and <hi>Gods holineſs;</hi> God is the ſupream Lord, and muſt be obeyed; he is the holy one, and muſt be ſanctified in each command: the beams of his majeſty and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſparkle out, and theſe faith takes in to melt the heart into a compliance with the divine will. <hi>Plato</hi> being asked by one of his Scholars, how long his precepts were to be obeyed, anſwered, <hi>Donec in terris apparuerit ſacratior aliquis, qui ſontem veritatis aperiat,</hi> the believer deſires to be ruled by God, becauſe an higher and holier can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:63874:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This reſignation is made to the word.</hi> Ask a believer how he knows himſelf to be where he would be, in the dominions of God and Chriſt, his anſwer will be, I know it by the command in the word, and in the command his faith eyes two things, <hi>the truth of the command</hi> and <hi>the ſoveraignty;</hi> his faith eyes the truth of it, the command is true, as coming from God himſelf, and being the very counterpane of the holineſs in his heart; <hi>This is the will of God even your ſanctification,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 4.3. Gods will is in himſelf, but the command is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane of it, <hi>thy word is true from the beginning,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 109.160. or as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is, <hi>the head of thy word is truth,</hi> the body of the command in Scripture anſwers to the head of it in the holy will of God. Faith looks on the command as iſſuing out of the very heart of God, and exactly agreeing thereunto, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account reſign to it, <hi>as to the good and acceptable will of God.</hi> Again, his faith eyes <hi>the ſoveraignty of it;</hi> naturally we would be Gods to our ſelves, and ſet up our wills as ſupream, and therefore we make war upon God and his Law: But when faith comes, God is God, and the Law a royal Law, and all the commands in Power and Majeſty, <hi>by them</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>is thy ſorvant warned,</hi> or as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Pſal.</hi> 19.11. the command to the believer is, as if a light ſhone from heaven, and a voice came <hi>from the excellent glory,</hi> ſaying, Do this or that. Gods will rides in triumph, and mans falls to the earth, as not able to ſtand before the Lord:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63874:62"/>The voice of a ſuperior, if perceived, puts an awe upon the inferior nature, ſo doth the voice of man upon beaſts, ſo doth the voice of Angels upon men, and (which is the greateſt awe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from the higheſt nature) ſo doth the voice of God upon the believer. After this manner doth faith yield up the ſoul to the command, and in it to God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the fourth thing, reſignation for a holy government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Faith reſigns up the ſoul for the gracious, reward of eternal life.</hi> And here to keep the old Method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This reſignation is made to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator.</hi> Faith cannot be ſatisfied with earth, that's but the Paradiſe of ſenſe; no, nor with preſent graces, theſe are but the pawns and earneſt-pennies of eternal life, faith aſpires after heaven. <hi>Oh! let me go over, and ſee the good Land, where the Mountains are all ſpices, the Rivers pleaſures, the Mountains are all ſpices, the Rivers pleaſures, the Air pure holineſs, the Eternal light God himſelf,</hi> ſaith faith, and for a title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, faith yields up the ſoul to Chriſt, who as <hi>a Prieſt</hi> hath merited heaven for us, and as <hi>a King</hi> is able to give it out to us. The <hi>Plebeian</hi> (ſaith <hi>Epictetus</hi>) looks for his gain from things without; the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> looks for it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but (which is a ſtrain higher) the <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> looks for his reward from Chriſt. <hi>Evagrius</hi> the Philoſopher gave (as the ſtory goes) three hundred pounds to <hi>Syneſius</hi> for the poor, to be repaid him by Chriſt in another world: the believer doth all at the ſame rate, hears, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63874:63"/>reads, and prays, and gives alms, and all to be paid in another world. Worldly men wonder at his hot purſuits after grace and holineſs, but he knows what theſe will go for in another world; that's the reaſon he follows hard after them, but in the purſuit ſtill his eyes are upon Chriſt as the great purchaſor and pay-maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, This reſignation in and through the Mediator is made to God.</hi> It is he that glorifieth, eternal life is Gods gift, our heavenly Fathers meer pleaſure; faith therefore yields up the ſoul to him for it, and herein it climbs up to him by his free-grace, <hi>the pure river of life flows out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 22.1. out of the regnant grace of God and merit of Chriſt as out of a fountain, the believer expects no eternal life but what iſſues out from thence. Thus the Reverend <hi>Soknius</hi> on his death bed expreſſed himſelf, <hi>Pendeo totus à Dei miſerieor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diâ, I wholly depend on Gods mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This reſignation is made to the Word.</hi> There is the promiſe of eternal life extant, and there the way to eternal life is chalked out, there is the promiſe of eternal life mapped out, a mercy above all the ſphear of nature: Hence the antient believers were <hi>as pilgrims here, Heb.</hi> 11.13. as if the world were too little for them, they were altogether for <hi>the heavenly country,</hi> which faith ſees at a diſtance in the promiſe: There alſo the way to eternal life is chalked out, <hi>the world paſſes away, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. Riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are but the way of time, but holineſs and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63874:63"/>righteouſneſs are <hi>the way everlaſting, Pſal.</hi> 139.24. the good acts may paſs, but their record is in heaven; the good men muſt dye, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhall never ſee corruption; the repentant tears which fall to the earth, are bottled with God; the charity which ſeems loſt as bread caſt on the waters, will come to hand again. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> when he caſt his ring into the ſea, little thought to have met it again in his fiſh; but the believer doing good works, expects to meet them again in another world, <hi>ſowing to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> he looks for a crop in eternal life. <hi>Dorcas</hi> may leave her coats and garments behind her, but the charity will follow her into another world; <hi>the commandement is eternal life,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.50. the very way to it. The believer obeying, may in ſome ſenſe ſay as dying <hi>Pollio, jam ingredior in vitam aeternam, now I am entring into eternal life,</hi> into that which will ſurvive the world and live in glory. Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to the word, not only as it is the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eternal life in the promiſe, but as it is the director to it in the command.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the ſecond thing, for what things and purpoſes this reſignation is made. But to proceed to the third thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, What are the Adjuncts and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this reſignation? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the following particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This reſignation is made in the way of God.</hi> Believers wait upon God for very great things: <hi>Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63874:64"/>hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides theſe, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. But where do they wait for theſe great things, where but in Gods own way? Thus it follows, <hi>thoſe that remember thee in thy ways, v.</hi> 5. Look in what way or method God gives out a mercy, in the ſame way or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod doth faith wait to receive it. Would a man have a pardon, faith waits for it in Gods way; free-grace as immenſe a ſea as it is in God, doth not flow out every way upon ſinners, but through the bleeding wounds of Chriſt. <hi>We are juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. Mark, free-grace iſſues out through redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and in that way faith waits for it: Thus St. <hi>Peter, We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved, Act.</hi> 15.11. he calls the grace of God <hi>the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as being merited by him. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever waits for pardoning mercy, but it muſt be <hi>the mercy of David,</hi> coming through the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the true <hi>David.</hi> Whether God might not <hi>per po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam ſuam abſolutam, remit ſin without a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> is a queſtion may be ſpared; Gods will is declared, the Scripture is definitive, <hi>there is no other name given among men, but the name of Jeſus,</hi> no other remiſſion but <hi>through his blood:</hi> the glory of the Lord, that is, his free-grace, comes into the Temple of the Church <hi>by the way of the Eaſt, Ezek.</hi> 43.2. that is, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Eaſt, Luk.</hi> 1.78. towards which the true believer bows down
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63874:64"/>himſelf for all grace. The <hi>Socinians</hi> grace, ſuch as is ſuppoſed to iſſue forth without the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, is not indeed the grace of God, but a fancy, an Idol of their own heart, <hi>He that abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh. v.</hi> 9. therefore ſuch an one muſt not be <hi>received,</hi> or <hi>ſaluted with God ſpeed, v.</hi> 10. Let the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who abides not in the doctrine of a redeeming and ſatisfying Chriſt, cry up free-grace, and that (as he thinks) in the pureſt and higheſt ſtrains, without all money and price, even without that of the Mediator. After all this he hath not God or free-grace in the right notion of it, the true believer dares not entertain ſuch a grace, or ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to it, leſt he ſhould <hi>bleſs an Idol,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce in a thing of nought;</hi> ſuch a grace is a meer ſtranger to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and therefore faith, whoſe skill is only in that Dialect, cannot own it, though humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpeak never ſo fair for it. Again, would a believer have <hi>mortification?</hi> he would have it in Gods way, he ſeeks it not <hi>Macedonius</hi>-like, by ſtanding in a ditch all the day, nor as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine-monks,</hi> by lying as dead unburied men on the earth, nor with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by Pilgrimages and outward pennances, nor with the <hi>Flagelian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> in their ſcourging and bloody whipping their own bodies. No, this is not Gods way, in all this Pageantry of mortification, they are at hoſtility with nature rather then with ſin, and in ſhooting all their arrows at the body, they miſs the mark, the chief ſeat of ſin in the heart: <hi>Neſciunt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitioſi</hi> (ſaith a Learned man) <hi>Deum amare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutationem
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63874:65"/>cordium, non dilaniationem corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſuperſtitious men know not that God loves changing of hearts rather then renting of bodies:</hi> the true believer ſeeks mortification in and by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, our old man is crucified with him, Rom.</hi> 6.6. As long as we are <hi>in the old Adam,</hi> ſin will be lively, but as ſoon as we are <hi>in Chriſt the wiſdom and power of God,</hi> ſin, which is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly of man, dies in us. The believer ſeeks after the ſpirit of Chriſt, as after that which can lay our luſts a ſteep in godly ſorrow, and nail them to the croſs of Chriſt, and let out their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blood, even the inward love thereof. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, a believer would have <hi>inſtruction</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> but he would have it in Gods way. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that Images are Lay-mens books, and whileſt the Bible is to the unlearned a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed letter, theſe are Letters Patents, open to all men, he that runs may read God as it were in great Capital letters. <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> though he condemned their adoration, yet he allowed their preſence in Churches, <hi>tanquam eſſent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moracula &amp; rudium literae;</hi> but alas! <hi>can the dumb Idol ſpeak?</hi> or if it could, <hi>can a teacher of lies inſtruct?</hi> may that be our memorial which hath made many forget God? <hi>Did God ever licence the printing of ſuch Lay-mens books?</hi> and if it have not his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> by an inſtitution, how can we expect his benediction? ſurely this is none of Gods way; faith ſaith, the image of God is in the word, and the only crucifix in the Goſpel. The <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> would be taught in an immediate and extraordinary way, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63874:65"/>goes to the word, there is the School where he would be taught of God, there are the gates and door-poſts where he would hear wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, This reſignation is made to its entice object, and not by piece-meal.</hi> As to God the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate object, the believer would not pick and chuſe among his Attributes, but is for them all, he would not have a God all of grace, but ſuch as he is, an holy one and a juſt, who will be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified even in our approaches to touch his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter. The believer, whileſt he caſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon Gods grace, would be aſſimulated to his holineſs, when he catches hold on mercy, withall he trembles at divine juſtice, as he waits for the ſmilings of Gods face, ſo he walks as in his preſence; all places to the believer are <hi>Bethels</hi> and <hi>Peniels,</hi> full of God, and too dreadful to ſin in. If any man go about by his faith to ſingle out grace from among the other Attributes, and ſuck that honicomb of infinite ſweetneſs by it ſelf alone, he doth not believe but preſume, like thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for money, yet will they lean upon the Lord, Mic.</hi> 3.11. O vain preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! for them ſtanding upon ſuch unholy ground, to lean upon the Lord, is an utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility. A traitor who ſtrikes off his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Crown, or with <hi>Hacket</hi> ſtabs at his image, doth not, cannot, at that time caſt himſelf on his Grace or Royal favour: A ſinner, whileſt by his ſinful rebellions he ſtrikes at the Soveraignty or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63874:66"/>ſtabs at the holineſs of God, doth not, cannot, lean upon his free-grace. St. <hi>John</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the caſe, <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye, and do not the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. Let ſuch an one cry up free-grace, free-grace, never ſo much, he doth but truſt in a lye, there is no ſuch grace as he dreams of, none but what comes from the holy one as the giver of it, none but what teaches the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a leſſon of holineſs. Again, as to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator,</hi> the believer is for All Chriſt, not only for him as a meriting and atoning Prieſt, but for him as a teaching Prophet, and ruling Lord alſo. Whileſt he wraps up himſelf in the pure robes of Chriſts righteouſneſs, at the ſame inſtant <hi>his ear is open to diſcipline,</hi> and his heart unfolds <hi>the everlaſting doors to let in the King of glory;</hi> he puts the Crown upon his head, and ſets him upon the throne of the heart, ſinging <hi>bleſſing, honour, power, glory, to the Lamb for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> That Chriſt who is in glory in heaven at the right hand of Majeſty, comes to be in glory in the heart by the reſignations of faith. Thus he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf faith, <hi>the ſpirit ſhall glorifie me, Joh.</hi> 16.14. that is, by working faith in the heart, as the Father glorifies him above, ſo the ſpirit, and under that faith, glorifie him below. If any man go about by his faith to pick out the merits and righteouſneſs of Chriſt for ſalvation, without a reſpect to his teaching and ruling offices, he mangles and tears in pieces Chriſt, as much as in him lieth, renting of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nay and <hi>Jeſus in twain,</hi> whom he admits only to ſave him from the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63874:66"/>guilt of ſin and not from the power and love of it, ſeparating the <hi>blood</hi> of his Saviour from the <hi>water,</hi> and his <hi>merits</hi> from <hi>the ſpirit,</hi> which are and ever muſt be in conjunction; ſuch an half and divided Chriſt as this is, is not <hi>the Chriſt of God,</hi> but a Chriſt of his own fancy, one that will ſave him in his ſins, and juſtifie him in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs; he that believes in ſuch a Chriſt, doth at once miſerably cheat his own ſoul, and as much as in him lieth, profanely trample on the blood of Chriſt, as if it were ſhed on purpoſe that ſinful men might have the reins laid down on their necks to riot in their curſed luſts with all impunity. Moreover, <hi>as to the word of God,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is for all of it, he is not only for cordials, and pots of Manna, and diſtillations of grace in the promiſes, but for precepts alſo, <hi>his meat and his drink is to do the will of his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> whileſt his eyes are on the Land of promiſe, his feet are in the Land of uprightneſs. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> boaſt themſelves to be above the Law, and as free as if they were in heaven, and that their ſins are but ſeeming ſins, ſins to ſenſe and to the world outwardly, but no ſins to faith and before God who ſeeth no ſin in them. But alaſs! theſe are but <hi>ſwelling words of vanity, to be above the Law is Antichriſt-like to be above God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> whoſe Majeſty and holineſs break forth in it; and if ſins be but ſeeming ſins, the Law is but a ſeeming Law, and God (whoſe authority and ſanctity ſhine forth in it) is but a ſeeming God: Promiſes and Precepts run together in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and muſt be taken together into the heart
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63874:67"/>by faith. Promiſes are effluxes out of Gods grace, and faith takes them in by recumbency; Precepts are effluxes out of Gods holineſs, and faith takes them in by obediential ſubjection, both muſt continue and be owned by faith, as long as there are grace and holineſs in God. The true believer neither with the <hi>Antinomian</hi> picks out the promiſes from the precepts, nor yet with the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> doth he pick out only ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as do not croſs his beloved luſts, as the Papiſts have razed out the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome of their Catechiſms, becauſe of their outward images, ſo the Hypocrite razes out the diſpleaſing Commandements in his practice, becauſe of the Idol-luſts in his heart; but the true believer, as <hi>David,</hi> is for all the wills of God, without any ſalvoes, becauſe without any indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This reſignation is made purely upon a Scriptural warrant.</hi> There may be hay and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the believer, but there is none in his faith; which, ſo far as it is faith, ſtands only upon holy ground. All faiths aſſents ſtand upon Scripture-propoſitions, all its affiances upon Scripture-promiſes, and all its obedience upon Scripture-precepts: What <hi>Balaam ſaid by an over-ruling providence,</hi> that ſaith the believer by the inſtinct of faith, <hi>I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord to do leſs or more, Num.</hi> 22.18. he would not as to doctrinals be wiſe above what is written, nor as to worſhip be religious above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor as to mercies and comforts be an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant above what is written. He would not as to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63874:67"/>doctrinals be wiſe above what is written: when the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> met at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> the Papiſts would firſt diſpute about the Canon of Faith, the Lutherans replyed, that the Scriptures were the only rule, at which the Papiſts cried out, that it was very unequal to tye them to one kind of weapon only, but faith is content with Scriptural doctrines only. There is <hi>one Mediator</hi> in Scripture, and faith dares not multiply them; there is <hi>one Scripture purgatory in Chriſts blood,</hi> and faith will not invent another; there is <hi>one propitiatory ſacrifice offered up once for all upon the Croſs,</hi> and faith will not ſeek after any more. All the points in Popery are but ſo many addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the word, and upon that account inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant to faith. The firſt error in the firſt ſin was an addition to the word, the woman ſaying, <hi>ye ſhall not touch it, Gen.</hi> 3.3. whereas Gods word only was, <hi>ye ſhall not eat of it, Gen.</hi> 2.17. and the firſt and primordial error which hath uſhered in all the Romiſh doctrines into the Church, hath been the very ſame thing; and becauſe they are additions, faith cannot own them, no not faith in a Papiſt: opinion may own them, but faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, for it is but the ſouls <hi>Eccho</hi> to the voice of God in Scripture, and where there is no voice, there can be no return; humane doctrines found not at all to faith, Scripture is all. <hi>Biſhop Fiſher</hi> a little before his ſuffering lighting on that one ſweet paſſage, <hi>this is life eternal to know thee and Jeſus Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 17.3. brake out into theſe words, <hi>here's learning enough for me:</hi> the believer, who hath the whole Scripture before him, may
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63874:68"/>well ſay, <hi>here's doctrine enough for me,</hi> faith will not turn vagrant and lye about at humane doors for doctrines, there is enough in the word. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the believer would not as to <hi>worſhip</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious above what is written; that of the Schoolmen, <hi>cultus eſt à naturâ, modus à lege, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus à gratiâ, worſhip is from nature, the manner from the Law, the power from grace,</hi> is very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. The very light of nature ſaith, God is to be worſhipped, but faith goes to the word for the manner, and to free-grace for the power. God in the ſecond Commandement forbids graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not as <hi>falſe objects of worſhip,</hi> which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the firſt Commadement, but as <hi>falſe means and manner of worſhip,</hi> and under graven Images, as being the chiefeſt and groffeſt kind of falſe worſhip. God doth forbid all other falſe worſhip humanely deviſed, ſuch as theſe were: hence true faith looks on all humanely deviſed worſhips as ſo many <hi>graven Images,</hi> a kind of <hi>Teraphim,</hi> expreſſing, though not as they did, an humane ſhape, yet an humane deviſe and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, things void of God, without inſtitution and without benediction. That of the Prophet, <hi>who hath required this at your hand, Iſa.</hi> 1.12. falls like thunder on all the imagery of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, daſhing them to pieces in a moment. <hi>Quintinus</hi> the Libertine, being preſent at a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Maſs with a Cardinal, boaſted that he ſaw the glory of God. I ſuppoſe according to his looſe principles of being under no outward Law, he would have ſaid as much if he had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Pagans at their Idolatrous worſhip; but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63874:68"/>the true believer looks for that glory only in the Sanctuary of Divine Inſtitutions, there and there only God <hi>records his Name, and commands the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi> Moreover the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever as to <hi>mercies and comforts</hi> would not be an expectant above what is written. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> that <hi>he died according to the word of the Lord, Deut.</hi> 38.5. or (as the Original may be read) <hi>he died upon the mouth of the Lord;</hi> the believer loves to live and dye upon Gods mouth in the promiſes, there watching for the ſweet words of grace dropping from him: he walks among the Promiſes, as the Phyſitian among his herbs, and by a divine inſtinct knows this is good for ſuch a condition, and that for another; and when he comes to that promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> he ſaith, this is the univerſal Medicine, and good for all things, as infinite a ſea as Gods grace is, as vaſt a treaſure as Chriſts merits, the believer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to climb up to theſe, unleſs he have ſomewhat of a promiſe to ſet his faith upon; if there be but an half-promiſe, faith will aſcend up by it: when God ſaith, <hi>ſeek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs, it may be you ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger, Zeph.</hi> 2.3. faith will hang upon a may be, but where there is nothing at all of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, faith does not, cannot tell how to approach for the unpromiſed thing. The Perfectioniſts fay, that ſinleſs perfection is attainable in this life; <hi>Joſeph is yet alive,</hi> perfection of life, figured by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> may be found, ſo thinks a <hi>Learned Doctor, My yoke is eaſie,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, and from thence <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludes, <hi>Legem Dei poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63874:69"/>eſſe renatis imo &amp; facilem obſervatu;</hi> but alaſs theſe are but dreams and not acts of faith. Its true, the believer groaning under the burden of ſin, wiſhes nothing more then ſinleſs perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he works, he walks, he prays, he weeps, he runs, he ſtrives, but after all he may not believe ſinleſs perfection attainable here; not but that the grace of God in Chriſt is ſufficient to effect it, but there is no channel for ſuch a grace to run in, no promiſe in all the word to bottom ſuch a perſuaſion upon: there is a promiſe for <hi>the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of iniquity,</hi> but not for <hi>the annihilating it,</hi> a promiſe that <hi>ſin ſhall not reign in us,</hi> but none that it ſhall not <hi>be;</hi> therefore the believer would not ſeek for that <hi>in himſelf,</hi> which is only found <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> nor for that on <hi>earth</hi> which is reſerved for <hi>heaven;</hi> that mercy or comfort which is not let down in the promiſe, faith doth not expect or look for. <hi>Trubern</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Divine on his deathbed, ſeeking comfort, ſpake thus, <hi>textum, textum volo, let me have the text, the text,</hi> well knowing that comfort ſtreams out in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; the believer is ever for one promiſe or other, to give advantage to his faith in its aſcenſion to God for mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, This reſignation is a voluntary act.</hi> It hath been diſputed between <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> where the ſeat of faith is, whether in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> only, or in the <hi>Will</hi> alſo; the Apoſtle clearly determines it, <hi>with the heart man believeth, Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>the heart</hi> includeth both faculties, <hi>ad eſſe fidei virtutis concurrit actus
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63874:69"/>rationis ſimul &amp; voluntatis, quod benè innuit Apoſtolus in ipſâ notifieatione fidei, cum dicit fidem eſſe ſubſtantiam rerum ſperandarum, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum non apparentium, tangens quod eſt in eâ cognitionis, &amp; quod eſt aſſectionis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> the <hi>aſſent</hi> of faith is in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the <hi>reſignation</hi> is in the Will, <hi>credere eſt conſentire, conſenſio autem volentis eſt,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> We read in Scripture of <hi>faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned,</hi> and ſincerity is in the Will, of <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of faith,</hi> and obedience is in the Will, of <hi>leaning, rolling, reſting, caſting</hi> our ſelves upon God, and all theſe are in the Will; all the reſignations which the believer makes, are acts of his Will; if he reſign to the Promiſes, and through them to the meriting Mediator, and through him to the free-grace of God, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency or fiducialneſs is in his Will; if he reſign to the commands, and through them to the kingdom of the Mediator, and through him to the holineſs of God, this obediential frame is in his Will; if he reſign for inſtruction to the Word, and through it to the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and through him to the wiſdom of God; this docibleneſs, this tender holy fleſh is in his Will; he would have ſalvation coming in a way of grace, and grace flowing through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Jeſus Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt for a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ruler as well as for a Saviour, and all this is his choice. 'Tis not a meer <hi>velleity</hi> or <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvium</hi> of a light deſire, like that of <hi>Balaam, let me dye the death of the righteous,</hi> but an act of his Will; 'tis not a mood or hot ſit of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63874:70"/>devotion, ſuch as falls on men under warming and awakening ordinances, but a deliberate act, 'tis not a conſtraint or piece of ſervility, ſuch as men uſually have in ſick and dying hours, when they are rolling off from this world, and upon the brink of eternity, with a proſpect of heaven and hell before them, but it is a <hi>true</hi> and a <hi>free-will,</hi> cordially and freely offering up the ſoul to the terms and methods of ſalvation in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, This reſignation is made in Humility.</hi> The believer, like his father <hi>Abraham, is called to Gods foot,</hi> there to lye in the loweſt poſture of a ſinful creature, in an humble docibleneſs he lyes at the foot of Gods wiſdom, waiting as they that watch for the morning, till the holy irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations make the day dawn, and the <hi>day-ſtar ariſe in the heart;</hi> in an obediential frame he lyes at the foot of Gods holineſs, crying out like <hi>Paul</hi> ſtruck down to the earth, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> and in a fiducial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency he lies at the foot of Gods grace, as a forlorn beggar, full of fores and extremities, waiting if free-grace will take him in, and, like the good <hi>Samaritane,</hi> bind up his wounds, <hi>pouring in the oyl and wine</hi> of mercy into his heart. <hi>The men</hi> among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not enter into the Land of promiſe, but <hi>the little ones</hi> did ſo, the myſtery is the Chriſtians, though the hiſtory be theirs: the <hi>men</hi> among us, ſuch as can few ſig-leaves together and cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuch as can feed themſelves at home, and keep houſe upon their own reaſon, ſuch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63874:70"/>as are Lords of their own actions, coming and going <hi>ad placitum,</hi> theſe do not believe, nor enter into the promiſes of the Goſpel, but the <hi>little ones,</hi> who cannot dreſs themſelves, but as free-grace ſwadles and wraps them up in Chriſts righteouſneſs, nor feed themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs free-grace pluck out the breaſt and milk out inſtruction, nor rule themſelves, or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but as free-grace takes them by the hand and leads them in holy ways, theſe are they that <hi>believe and enter into reſt:</hi> hence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>Except ye become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, Mat.</hi> 18.3. The proud man will not ſuffer grace to reign in or over him, but the believer is as a little child ruleable by all the will of God, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmitting to all the methods of ſalvation in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this diſcourſe about the Adjuncts of faith, I ſhall only add a caution or two. When I ſay that all true believers do thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I mean not that all have the ſame formal notions or expreſſions, but the ſame faith and reſignation for the ſubſtance of it; <hi>the root of the matter</hi> is in the weakeſt of them, though not the ſame verdure of notions or expreſſions, the ſubſtance or holy ſeed of true reſignation may be latent in a bruiſed reed or ſmoaking flax, in a poor ſpirit, or the pulſe of a deſire, I have read of a Noble perſon in <hi>Spain,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as was ſuppoſed, abſolutely dead,<note place="margin">Melch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

God accepts it; neither do I mean that this reſignation is acted perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but with many ſad pauſes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which happen partly by the blaſts of Satans temptations, making the believer walk like <hi>Peter upon the water,</hi> now a good ſtep, and then ready to ſink when the wind grows boiſterous, till his faith buoy him up again, with a <hi>Lord, ſave me,</hi> partly by the allurements and entanglements of the world, which are to him as the ſtone and the ſtring were to <hi>Anſelms</hi> bird, now up in aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſoul to God and Chriſt, and then down again to the earth and earthly things, and partly from the indwelling ſin which make him live, as his Saviour did on earth, a meer conflicting life, Chriſt <hi>endured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of ſinners,</hi> and he <hi>the contradiction of ſins;</hi> the indwelling corruption makes his ſoul, like a palſey hand with contrary motions, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> whileſt faith moves forward, unbelief draws back; after he hath in a <hi>princely manner wreſtled with God,</hi> he goes off <hi>Jacob-like halting</hi> in one infirmity or other.</p>

               <p>It remains that I lay down my reaſons, why I place the <hi>vitality</hi> and <hi>eſſential nature</hi> of faith, as it is the condition of the Goſpel, in ſuch a <hi>reſignation</hi> as is before deſcribed. And for this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That precious faith, which is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical condition, is <hi>more then a bare naked aſſent to the Goſpel-truth,</hi> and <hi>leſs then an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of love and pardon from God,</hi> wherefore it muſt needs be ſome middle thing between both, ſuch as Reſignation is. I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make good both propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Pretious faith is more then a bare naked aſſent to the Goſpel-truth.</hi> This will be clear by the enſuing conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A naked aſſent is but <hi>credere Deo,</hi> a believing Scriptural axiomes to be true; but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63874:72"/>pretious faith is a far nobler thing, and therefore very emphatically painted out in Scripture; in the Old Teſtament 'tis <hi>credere in Deum, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jehovah, Gen.</hi> 15.6. importing a fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act, 'tis <hi>a truſting in the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 2.12. where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word imports <hi>a flying for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> a running under the wings of free-grace as chickens do under the hen; 'tis <hi>a leaning upon God, Iſa.</hi> 50.10. as not able to ſtand alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a recumbency on mercy; 'tis <hi>a rolling our ſelves upon God, Pſal.</hi> 37.5. as weary and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſt till we come to lodg in goodneſs; in the New Teſtament, 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>a believing into Chriſt,</hi> very frequent in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> a phraſe wholly the holy ſpirits, never found in any Greek Author, a bare aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may <hi>believe about Chriſt,</hi> but the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever <hi>believes into Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to be in neer union with him; 'tis <hi>a putting on of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 13.14. the believer ſtrips himſelf of his luſts, nay and of his own righteouſneſs, to be inveſted with Chriſt; 'tis <hi>a receiving of Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 1.12. all Chriſt, merit and ſpirit, croſs and crown together, 'tis a faith which hath <hi>its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God</hi> as its ultimate center, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Scripture is but a <hi>medium,</hi> the ultimate object is God himſelf: All which imports of precious faith are much above the ſphear of a meer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Precious faith is the very conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63874:72"/>life, Joh.</hi> 3.16. but a naked aſſent is not ſuch; that is required not only in the Goſpel, but in the moral Law too; and found not only in godly, but wicked men, nay, and in devils themſelves, who <hi>believe and tremble.</hi> It is true ſome Scriptures ſeem to lay much upon aſſent; thus we find, <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 10.9. And, <hi>whoſoever believeth, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. And, <hi>theſe things are written, that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing you might have life through his name, Joh.</hi> 20.31. But theſe places import not as if a naked aſſent were the ſull condition of Goſpel-grace, for then a man might be ſaved in his ſins, a man in arms againſt his maker might ſtand; Gods grace might embrace him whom his holineſs abhors, and Chriſt might ſive him who will not have him reign over him; light might be in communion with darkneſs, and Chriſt might have concord with Belial; all which are impoſſibles in themſelves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſſibles with the deſign of the Goſpel: but they intend ſuch an aſſent as is in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a true reſignation of the heart to the terms of the Goſpel. <hi>Corde credere, quad Deus eum excitaverit, eſt non mode aſſentiri hiſtoriae de excitato Jeſu, ſed &amp; cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Precious faith doth unite us unto Chriſt, and gives us a being in him: A belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the firſt inſtant of faith is no longer <hi>in himſelf</hi> or the old <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>a man in Chriſt;</hi> hence the ſame royal robe of righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath upon himſelf, covers him alſo, which renders faith exceeding precious. <hi>George Prince of Anhalt</hi> was upon this account much delighted with this ſimilitude, <hi>As the ring is highly prized for the diamond in it, ſo faith juſtifies us for the pearl of price, the Son of God, whom it apprehends;</hi> the believer is <hi>found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9. Hence alſo the very ſame ſpirit of holineſs which is upon Chriſt in heaven above meaſure, falls down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the believer according to meaſure; a piece
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63874:73"/>of bread is a poor imnimate thing in it ſalt, but when by digeſtion it comes into the body and is tranſubſtantiated into fleſh, there is an humane ſpirit in it; a man before faith is an earthly carnal thing, but as ſoon as by faith he becomes a member of Chriſt, a piece as it were of his fleſh and of his bones, he hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit in him, even the ſame with Chriſt; Chriſt above and he below, and the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in both: a great myſtery, ſuch as a naked aſſent cannot reach unto: he that hath no more is but a glaſs eye, or wooden leg in the body of Chriſt, or rather he is not at all in it, but outwardly tied to it by a name and form of knowledge, without any part in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By virtue of its union with Chriſt, Precious faith bears many excellent fruits, it uſhers in a ſpiritual life into the ſoul; that of the Prophet, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> thrice quoted by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is exempliſied in every believer; but he that hath but a naked aſſent, though with a goodly ſtructure of Evangclical truths ſtanding upon it, is but a dead man, and his notions, like the <hi>Egyptian Pyramides,</hi> are but monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the dead. Again, it brings down pardon of ſin into the ſoul. <hi>whoſoever believeth in him</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>ſhall receive remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, Acts</hi> 10.43. but a naked aſſent leaves a man as faſt in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of guilt as ever before. Moreover, <hi>it purifies, the heart,</hi> and quenches the fiery darts of Satan, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63874:74"/>out the duſt and rubbiſh out of the heart, and makes it a ſanctuary or holy place for God, and if Satan come and let fly his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, it beats them off from the ſoul. Thus <hi>Bucer</hi> when in his ſickneſs he was admoniſhed to arm himſelf againſt Satan, anſwered, <hi>in Chriſto ſum, nihil habeo cum diabolo commune, I am in Chriſt, and have nothing in common with Satan;</hi> but where there is only a naked aſſent, the holy truths going no further then the Underſtanding, the Will is left in the mire and pollution of its luſts, and is ready, as ſoon as the tempter comes, to join with his ſeducing proffers.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the firſt propoſition, <hi>that faith is more then a naked aſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond propoſition is, <hi>That faith is leſs then an aſſurance of love and pardon from God;</hi> only we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween faith in the <hi>root</hi> and faith in the <hi>flower;</hi> between faith in the loweſt ſtature, and faith in its full-grown perfections. That aſſurance which the infant faith cannot reach, the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown faith may arrive at; which I ſuppoſe was the reaſon that thoſe prime Reformers <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and after them <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Zanchy,</hi> with many others, did define faith by a <hi>plerophory</hi> or <hi>full perſwaſion of Gods love,</hi> they being themſelves in the joys of faith, drew its picture not according to the infant model, but the perfect lineaments thereof, as they found them in themſelves, ſo they held them out to the world. Again, we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63874:74"/>between <hi>ſeminal</hi> aſſurance and <hi>actual;</hi> an infant faith hath <hi>ſeminal</hi> aſſurance, <hi>light is ſown for the righteous, Pſal.</hi> 97.11. but the crop of comfort doth not immediately ſpring up, the weakeſt believer is heir to all the joys of heaven, only he doth not preſently know his title, he hath not ordinarily actual aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at the very firſt; I ſay, not ordinarily, for we muſt not limit the holy one, who by his royal prerogative may let in the ſweet ſenſe of his love in the firſt inſtant of believing. Theſe diſtinctions premiſed, the meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, <hi>That faith in its loweſt meaſure, which is the condition of the Goſpel, doth not eſſentially include aſſurance.</hi> And this I ſhall manifeſt by the enſuing conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, All true believers have not aſſurance.</hi> Scripture and experience manifeſt it; there are Lambs which are gathered into the arms and laid in the boſome of free-grace, yet know not where they are. There are little ones, babes in Chriſt, which can only hang upon the breaſt, and are not grown up into the reflections and joys of faith; <hi>the poor in ſpirit, the mourners, the hungry and thirſty after righteouſneſs,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the fifth chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> are all of them true believers, bleſſed ones, and heirs of the promiſes, and yet all of them are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any glimpſe of aſſurance; the poor in ſpirit, all in rags of unworthineſs and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothingneſs, as if he had no title to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the mourners weeping and deſolate,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63874:75"/>like <hi>Hagar</hi> in the wilderneſs with her bottle ſpent, as if there were no Well of comfort near them; the hungry and thirſty, like men in a famine, drooping and fainting away in fits of ſoul-emptineſs, as if there were no ſuch thing as hidden Manna for them. It is very obſervable in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that Chriſt takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>the tender grape</hi> juſt at its firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the very firſt opening or budding forth of faith is welcom to him; if the wine be but in the cluſter, if there be but faith in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>deſtroy it not, the bleſſing of Abraham is in it,</hi> out of this little <hi>grain of muſtard-ſeed</hi> heaven will grow, in this <hi>ſmoking ſlax</hi> there's a divine ſpark, though the ſmoak of doubts and temptations muffle it up in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, it will break out at laſt into ſlames of love and joy; in the infant-believers aſſurance is not to be expected, becauſe of their primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial weakneſs; and in well-grown believers it may be ſuſpended, becauſe of Gods infinite ſoveraignty in the diſpenſing thereof as he pleaſeth. <hi>Cruciger</hi> on his death-bed prayed thus, <hi>Invoco te Domine languidâ &amp; imbecillâ ſide, ſed ſide tamen, Lord, I call upon thee with a weak and languiſhing faith, but yet with a faith.</hi> Pious <hi>Juſtus Jonas,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with <hi>Luther</hi> at his death, and took as it were his laſt breath into his boſome, was in his own ſickneſs ſainting and cold-hearted, till a ſervant of his rubbed him up with ſome comforts out of the Goſpel, Holy <hi>Bayn</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I thank God, ſuſtentation in Chriſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63874:75"/>I have, and ſome little ſtrength, ſuavities ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual I taſt not any:</hi> even the choice ſervants of God may <hi>walk in darkneſs and ſee little or no light,</hi> their light may be like that in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.6. <hi>neither clear nor dark,</hi> they may live <hi>in crepuſculo</hi> in a kind of twilight, in a mixture of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Faith goeth before juſtification, but aſſurance followeth after it.</hi> Faith goeth before juſtification. Scripture is expreſs in it, <hi>by him all that believe are juſtified, Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>the righteouſneſs of God is upon all them that believe, Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt that we might be juſtified, Galat.</hi> 2.16. might juſtification go before faith, it were poſſible that a man might be ſaved in his ſins, a child of wrath might be in the arms of divine love, a captive of Satan might be a ſon of God, a man out of Chriſt might be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him; all which are impoſſible, but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance follows after juſtification, juſtification is neceſſarily preſuppoſed to aſſurance; for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my ſins forgiven, that they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given is abſurd; to believe my ſins forgiven before they be forgiven, is falſe; to believe my ſins forgiven becauſe I believe ſo, is vain and fooliſh. Remiſſion muſt firſt he, before it can be manifeſted to be, it muſt firſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Court of heaven, before there can be any true Copy of it in conſcience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we allow a diſtinction between <hi>a faith of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63874:76"/>reſignation</hi> before, and <hi>a faith of aſſurance</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter juſtification, we cannot poſſibly deal with the <hi>Romaniſts. Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaking of that ſpecial faith whereby a man believes himſelf juſt before God in and through Chriſt, puts this <hi>Quaere;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De notis Eccleſiae. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Cum incipio credere me eſſe juſtum, vel ſum juſtus, vel injuſtus, ſi juſtus, non juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficor per fidem banc, quia iſta fides poſterior meâ juſtitiâ, ſi injuſtus, iſta fides eſt falſa, when I begin to believe my ſelf juſt, am I juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, if juſt, I am not juſtified by this faith which is after my righteouſneſs, if unjuſt, this faith is falſe;</hi> neither is there any imaginable way to diſſolve this knot regularly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a diſtinction between faith as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to juſtification, and faith as conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Faith juſtifieth us</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, aſſurance juſtifieth us</hi> in foro conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae, <hi>in our feeling, and declaratively only.</hi> Faith juſtifies us before God; all thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in St. <hi>Paul</hi> touching juſtification by faith, are meant of a juſtification before God. I ſhall name but one or two, that <hi>no man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for, the juſt ſhall live by faith, Gal.</hi> 3.11. the juſtification before God, here denied to the Law, is attributed to faith. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 2.16. He doth not ſay, faith declares a man juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that even the excluded works may do, but ſaith juſtifies: Faith ?uts on Chriſt and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63874:76"/>his righteouſneſs, aſſurance only bears witneſs that the wedding garment is on: Faith waits at the footſtool of free-grace to have a pardon ſealed in heaven, aſſurance copies it out and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it in conſcience; unleſs we admit this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, we open the flood-gates to <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Faith is a permanent thing,</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſeed which never dies, it is built upon the <hi>rock of ages,</hi> and cannot be moved, it hangs upon an infallible word, <hi>the leaſt jot or tittle thereof cannot fall to the ground,</hi> it is fed with an everlaſting ſpring, the holy ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the believer as <hi>a well of water ſpringing up to eternal life,</hi> but aſſurance is tranſient; now the believer hath nothing but wine and honycombs of grace, and a little after he hath a cup of gall and wormwood; now a ſheet full of celeſtial joys and comforts is let down to him, and then all is taken up into heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: he is much like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſometimes in the coat of many colours, in the viſible badges of his fathers love, and anon ſtript and caſt into the pit; like poor <hi>Heman, free among the dead,</hi> and laid in darkneſs, he is a ſpiritual <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> who is all day in heavenly amours, wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning about to the light of Gods countenance, and anon, when night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, contracts his leaves and hangs down his head, till there be another Sun; it the effence of faith be in aſſurance, the believer ſtands, as it were upon a <hi>ſea of glaſs,</hi> in a very lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricous condition, 'tis well with him whileſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63874:77"/>he hath the light of Gods countenance, whileſt Gods ſpirit bears witneſs to his, that he is a child of God; but what if God withdraw and retire as it were into his unapproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light? what if the crannies of the heart be all ſhut up, ſo that neither the ſunny beams of Gods favour, nor yet the ſtarry graces in the heart can appear? what if the arch-ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Satan come with thoſe inſtruments of death, the threatnings, and rake in the old wounds of ſin, and join the darkneſs of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the darkneſs of corruption in the believer, to cauſe, if it were poſſible, utter darkneſs? muſt he be an Apoſtate, a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, a man fallen from grace? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſpeaking of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods love, cries out, <hi>Rara hora, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis mora, O ſi durâſſet! it is a rare hour, but a ſhort ſtay, Oh that it would continue with me!</hi> the believers ſtanding is not in it, but in his union with Chriſt; this was nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exemplified to us in Chriſt, when he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, Math.</hi> 27.46. the <hi>hypoſtatical union</hi> was not diſſolved, but the <hi>preſent viſion</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted; in like manner the believer, the man in Chriſt, when in deſertions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, hath a ſure conjunction with Chriſt, even whileſt there is a ſuſpenſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; unleſs we own this diſtinction, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain the doctrine of perſeverance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Remonſtrants.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:63874:77"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Faith is the firſt-born of all graces,</hi> and leads the van to all the reſt, it is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-grace, and as it were teems out all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces; and no wonder, for it unites us to Chriſt, <hi>out of whoſe fulneſs we receive grace for grace,</hi> and <hi>into whoſe image we are changed from glory to glory as by the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> but aſſurance follows after faith and all other graces. This will be evident, if we conſider the manner how aſſurance is produced; it is not an <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> a voice, an internal locuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſpeaking to the heart ſome ſuch words as theſe, thou art in Gods favour, or thy ſins are forgiven, or thou art a ſon of God; no, it is in another way, the holy ſpirit doth ſo irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate the heart in its reflections, and all the pretious graces lodging there, that it plainly appears, that the grace of God is there of a truth; as it was with the blind man in the Goſpel, when his eyes were opened he could look abroad in the world and ſay, here's the earth, and there's the ſea, and yonder's the Sun, Moon and Stars, ſenſibly pointing from one creature to another: ſo it is with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, when he is irradiated by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he can look into his own heart and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally ſay, this is <hi>the pretious faith,</hi> and that is <hi>the love in incorruption,</hi> and the other is <hi>the meekneſs of wiſdom,</hi> and ſo go over all the parts of the new creature formed within him, or at leaſt over ſuch, or ſo many of them as may aſſure him that he is in a ſtate of grace. This is the way of aſſurance, firſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63874:78"/>there is a conſtellation of faith and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the heart, then theſe graces irradiated by the holy ſpirit ſend forth a kind of ſplendor, which the ſoul reflecting on it ſelf, taking up, it comes to attain aſſurance, well knowing that ſuch and ſuch things accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalvation, and import no leſs then a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour; notable is that of St. <hi>Paul, in whom after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, Eph.</hi> 1.13. Mark, <hi>after ye believed;</hi> firſt there muſt be faith, and the train of graces attend thereon, and then comes the ſeal of the ſpirit of promiſe, the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which endited the promiſes in the word, comes and ſeals them on the heart; whereas in the word there are ſuch promiſes made to faith and love and holineſs, the irradiating ſpirit plainly diſcovers that faith and that love and that holineſs to be indeed in the heart, and ſo ſeals up the promiſes to the believer in particular, as if it had expreſly ſaid, this or that promiſe belongs to thee. Hence the believer ſo ſealed may ſay of the promiſes, as <hi>Origen</hi> did of thoſe Scriptures which did much affect him, <hi>haec eſt Scriptura mea,</hi> this promiſe is mine, and that promiſe is mine; nay, all the Land of promiſe, as much as I can ſet my foot on, is mine own. There are <hi>three ſeals</hi> to the promiſes, firſt God ſeals them for true in the blood of his own Son, in whom all of them are <hi>Yea and Amen;</hi> then man ſeals them for true by faith, <hi>he that believeth, ſets to his ſeal that God is true;</hi> and then again
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63874:78"/>God ſeals them for true to the believer in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular by his irradiating ſpirit. Faith then goes before all other graces, but aſſurance comes after them, as being no other then the clear evidence of their true exiſtence in the ſoul. Unleſs we allow this diſtinction, we gratifie the <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> who declaim againſt all marks of grace as legal things, and ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, Faith ſtands upon the word of God purely, totally and entirely.</hi> In point of expectation, it will not look without a word of promiſe; in point of obedience, it will not ſtir a foot without a word of command; in point of doctrine, it will not lend an ear without a word of inſtruction. Hence Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Inſt. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Perpetuam eſſe fidei re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velationem cum verbo, nec magis ab eo poſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli, quàm radios à Sole, unde oriuntur. Faith hath a perpetual relation to the word, and can no more be ſundred from it then the beams from the Sun, from whom they ariſe,</hi> ſhould it be ſundred from it, it would loſe its nature, and ceaſe to be faith; but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth not ſtand ſo purely, totally and entirely upon the word: this is alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the manner of attaining aſſurance, that is not made <hi>axiomatically</hi> in an <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> way, as if there were an inward voice, ſaying, thou art juſtified, but <hi>diſcourſively,</hi> and after ſome ſuch manner as in this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Syllogiſm, Whoſoever believeth, his ſins are forgiven, but I believe, Ergo, my ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:63874:79"/>Here the concluſion, which imports aſſurance in it, ſtands upon two propoſitions; the <hi>Major</hi> is meerly grounded upon the word, but the <hi>Minor</hi> ſtands upon ſpiritual ſenſe and experience cauſed by the holy ſpirit ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiating the ſoul in its reflections upon its own eſtate; therefore aſſurance which is comprized in the concluſion, doth not ſtand ſo meerly upon the word as faith doth: Thus the Learned <hi>Pemble,</hi> ſpeaking of that <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> ſaith, the <hi>major</hi> is of faith, the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of ſenſe and experience. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of both, but chiefly of faith, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on the premiſes by infallible argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and partly of ſenſe, as it is founded on the inward experience of Gods grace work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our ſouls. What the doctrine of Faith is, is to be ſought in Bibles, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a particular act of faith or not, ſuch as is comprized in the <hi>minor,</hi>

But for anſwer, The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>the Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the whole Church, is to be found in the Scripture; but the certainty of <hi>an act of Faith,</hi> which is in a particular man, is to be found in the heart by ſpiritual ſenſe and experience; and ſo in <hi>Bellarmines minor,</hi> the certainty of my turning to God ſtands not upon the word, but upon ſpiritual ſenſe and experience; yet nevertheleſs the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63874:80"/>which imports aſſurance, is <hi>de fide;</hi> for every concluſion is ſo, which ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one propoſition contained in Scripture, and upon another gathered from ſenſe or experience, as the caſe is in all ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Syllogiſms: yet withall, as I ſaid at firſt, the concluſion doth not ſtand ſo entirely on Scripture as a direct act of faith doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Faith is more purely faith then aſſurance is. In faith we <hi>look off from our ſelves;</hi> thus the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>looking off from our ſelves unto Jeſus Chriſt, Hebr.</hi> 12.2. but in aſſurance we <hi>look into our ſelves,</hi> by reflecting on our own eſtate. Whileſt faith goes out of ſelf, and hangs upon free-grace in one promiſe or other; aſſurance is at home, telling over its riches, and faring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly every day in the love of God: in faith there is nothing but meer dependance, but in aſſurance there is a mixture of ſenſe. If a poor man in his rags and extremities leave himſelf upon God for daily bread, as <hi>having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things</hi> in the promiſe, his faith is more purely faith then the rich mans is, who hath creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts flowing about him and running in at every ſenſe. If one <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> in the midſt of his wants and ſpiritual neceſſitles caſt himſelf upon free-grace; it is more meer faith then for one to ſit under aſſurance with pots of <hi>Manna</hi> and ſpiritual flagons round about him. When <hi>Jacob</hi> heard the report
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63874:80"/>of a living <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and put himſelf upon the chariots ſent for him, it was nothing but meer belief, but when he ſaw <hi>Joſephs</hi> face, his eyes were witneſſes of the thing: when a man that <hi>walketh in darkneſs and ſeeth no light,</hi> will yet hang on the report of a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and put himſelf upon the chariot of the promiſes, it is nothing elſe but pure faith; but when he comes to ſee the light of Gods face, and in it a piece of the heavenly viſion, it is not all faith, but faith and ſight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the ſecond propoſition, that faith is leſs then aſſurance: In which phraſe I intend not a compariſon between them in point of dignity, but only that pretious faith, ſuch as is the condition of the Goſpel, may really be where the garland of aſſurance is not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added; as a King is really a King before his Coronation, ſo faith is really faith before it be crowned with the ſenſe of Gods love.</p>
               <p>Theſe two propoſitions made good, I come at laſt to gather up my firſt reaſon: Faith is more then a naked aſſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and leſs then an aſſurance of love and pardon from God; therefore it muſt needs be ſome middle thing between both, ſuch as reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is. Let us put another practical Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever believeth, ſhall be ſaved. But I believe. Ergo, I ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:63874:81"/>the <hi>major</hi> propoſition is the object of aſſent, the concluſion is an act of aſſurance, but the <hi>minor</hi> or middle propoſition is an act of faith or reſignation: Reſignation includes aſſent, and, which is more, it yields up the ſoul to the terms of the Goſpel, but it doth not immediately arrive at aſſurance, as it was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he heard his mothers counſel touching the bleſſing; between his aſſent to the counſel, and his audible hearing the bleſſing pronounced on him, there was a putting on the garments of his elder brother; ſo it is with the believer, when his heavenly Father offers him the Evangelical bleſſing, between his aſſent and his aſſurance of the bleſſing, there is a putting on the robe of Chriſts rightcouſneſs: a meer aſſentor hath as it were but <hi>the ſight of his eyes,</hi> in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the rich treaſures of the Goſpel; a young believer hath <hi>a real title thereunto;</hi> and a man of aſſmance over and above his title, <hi>is able to bring his evidences and read them to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That faith conſiſts in reſignation, will appear from the way which God uſes in the working of faith.</hi> God works it in a way of perſwaſion, <hi>God ſhall perſwade Japheth, and he ſhall dwell in the tents of Shem, Gen.</hi> 9.27. that is, in the Church of God, where the true <hi>Shem, the name of Godis.</hi> When God comes with his Almighty Oratory and ſpeaks to the heart, perſwading, dwell not O man any lorger at home, in thy will or righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63874:81"/>come into <hi>Shem, into my Name,</hi> into my mercy by a true recumbence, into my holineſs by a cordial obedientialneſs, and by the ſweet ſtrains of free-grace the man is charmed into a ſurrender of himſelf unto the Divine call, then there is ſaith indeed.

                  </note> it contradicts and blaſphemes at the ſweet compellations of free-grace, if not outwardly, as thoſe wretches, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 6. yet inwardly, for <hi>it gives God the lye,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. Again, God works it in the evidence and demonſtration of the ſpirit; thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>His preaching was in the demonſtration of the ſpirit and power,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. and then, as a ſweet fruit thereof, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>faith ſtanding in the power of God</hi> in the very next verſe; when the ſpirit comes in its divine Logick, and demonſtratively points out, this is the <hi>true Jeſus,</hi> that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Goſpel, and here is the only way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the pure light and evidence preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ſo far upon the man, that, like one under a clear demonſtration, he is out-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63874:82"/>and cannot ſay nay to it, but yields and delivers up himſelf to the Goſpel, to be moulded and caſt into the holy figure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then there is true faith wrought in him. Hence faith is ſometimes ſet out by <hi>ſilence</hi> in Scripture, <hi>truly my ſoul waiteth on God, Pſal.</hi> 62.1. or as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, my ſoul is ſilent to God;</hi> when the truth comes in the clear evidence and demonſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ſoul is ſilent, let God ſay what he will, the ſoul contradicts not, but keeps an holy ſilence, ſcaling and ſubſcribing to the truth and goodneſs of God in every thing. Moreover, God works it in the power of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual arms, <hi>caſting down ſtrong holds, and captivating thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. when God comes to the heart, which naturally is as a ſtrong City, full of forts and towers of pride, and by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief barred and faſt locked up againſt all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truths, and layes a cloſe ſpiritual ſiege to it, and ſhuts it up under ſin and wrath, and makes inward batteries upon the forts and towers thereof, and the trumpet of the word ſounds louder and louder in conſcience, till the curſed walls fall down, and <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting gates be opened to the Lord of glory,</hi> and the heart ſurrender up it ſelf with all its thoughts, as a willing priſoner to thoſe Goſpel-truths which before it impriſoned in unrighteouſneſs, then there is precious faith indeed; the heart, which before was ſhut up, now opens it ſelf to the truth, as we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63874:82"/>ſee in <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16.14. When the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe</hi> vanquiſhed the <hi>Venetians</hi> in a ſea-ſight, and took the Iſland of <hi>Chioggia,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate ſent them a blank Charter, bidding them write down their own conditions, and they would accept thereof; when God by his word and ſpirit makes a conqueſt on the heart, and it yields up it ſelf as a blank for him to write all his wills and pleaſures in, then there is true faith wrought in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That faith ſtands in reſignation, will appear from the titles given unto faith in Scripture.</hi> 'Tis <hi>a leaning or rolling upon God, Cant.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. which are poſtures of reſignation; the believer doth not ſtand upon his own bottom, nor bear up his own weight, but layes all upon God. 'Tis <hi>a committing ones ſelf to God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. which is an act of reſignation; a believer pawns his ſoul to God, and as a pawn he leaves it upon God, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. well knowing that it cannot be in a ſurer hand, as it were going out of the poſſeſſion of himſelf, that he may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in the cuſtody of God. 'Tis <hi>a ſubmitting to the righteouſneſs of God, Rom.</hi> 10.3. which is the reſignation of a ſubject to his Prince; a believer caſts off his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as rags, and will be under no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſs but Chriſts. 'Tis <hi>a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our burden on the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 55. a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever finds ſins and wants too weighty for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63874:83"/>him to bear, and he throws off all upon God, who is able to pardon and ſupply him. In the Old Teſtament we have it called <hi>a truſting in God,</hi> and in the New <hi>a believing in Chriſt;</hi> a believer is not, as <hi>Adam,</hi> his own truſtee, he hath not his eſtate in his own hands, but all in a way of dependance upon God. Moreover, it is called <hi>a giving ones ſelf unto the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. a reſigning up the property a man hath in himſelf, that Chriſt may be <hi>all in all:</hi> A believer as to his being is not a man <hi>in himſelf,</hi> but a man <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> as to his living, <hi>it is not he that liveth, but Chriſt in him;</hi> and as to his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>it is not he that labours, but the grace of God with him;</hi> and to name but one more, it is <hi>a reſting on God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. a believer is not at reſt in himſelf, or the creature, but under perpetual toſſings and fluctuations, till he come to lay himſelf ſtedfaſtly upon God, as the Center of ſouls, and Sabbath of eternal reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, That faith ſtands in reſignation, may appear from the obſtacles of faith.</hi> Look what of ſin is an obſtacle to reſignation, is alſo an obſtacle to faith, and what of ſin may conſiſt with reſignation, may alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with faith. For the clear underſtanding whereof, I muſt firſt premiſe ſome diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there is original ſin and actual, there is actual ſin known and unknown, there is actual ſin of meer infirmity and incurſion,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63874:83"/>and actual ſin which hath will and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it; there is actual ſin in one ſingle act, and actual ſin in a ſeries and ſucceſſion of acts. Theſe diſtinctions premiſed, I ſhall lay down this point in divers propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, The meer in-being of original ſin doth not impede reſignation,</hi> and conſequently it doth not impede faith: whatever the actual outflowings of it may do while the oriſice of luſt is open, the meer in-being of it doth not impede, is is an inmate in the heart; when the firſt work of faith is wrought there, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God by his Almighty grace doth ſuſpend and bridle it that it doth not put forth, but lye hid in its own root: Thus ſay our famous Divines in <hi>the Synod of Dort,</hi> touching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; <hi>Divina haec actio non laedit volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis libertatem, neque tamen extirpat radicitùs vitioſam reſiſtendi poſſibilitatem, quamvis enim Deus in ipſo regenerationis opere adeo poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in voluntatem agat, ut actualiter reſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di potentia proxima pro illo tempore ſuſpenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, remotam tamen &amp; in actu prima poſitam reſiſtendi potentiam ne tum funditus extirpat, ſed in ſuâ amarâ radice deliteſcere permittit.</hi> God layes the precious foundation of faith and the new-creature, as it were in mighty waters, in the very ſame heart in which there is a fountain of ſin; only he doth as thoſe that build upon great Rivers do, put back the fountain to make room for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtructure, which is ſet up in the heart
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63874:84"/>in a very wonderful way, as the <hi>ſtones</hi> were in <hi>Jordan,</hi> corruptions, as the waters of that river, <hi>ſtanding on an heap on this ſide, and as it were cut off on that,</hi> whileſt free-grace is a doing the great work. On the other ſide, <hi>the indulgence of original ſin doth impede reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and by conſequence faith:</hi> A man that foothes up the old man and earthly members, and upon the view of his heart returns <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia benè,</hi> all is well as it is, the heart is good enough, cannot, whileſt ſuch, believe; and why? to believe is to reſign, and why or how ſhould he reſign to Chriſt for grace, who feels no want? ſuch an one really poor but opinionatively rich, turns off all the rich offers of grace, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did <hi>Jacobs</hi> preſent, <hi>I have enough,</hi> and goes away empty from all the treaſures of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, All unknown actual ſins are not obſtacles to reſignation, and ſo are not obſtacles to faith. Who can underſtand his errors? Pſal.</hi> 19.12. who ſo knowing as to know his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual errors? It hath been obſerved by ſome Papiſts, that there are above 200 er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Commentaries of <hi>Cardinal Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> de libr. Apoc.</note> in <hi>the Maſter of the ſentences,</hi> whom the Papiſts extol as more worth then one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Luthers,</hi> two hundred <hi>Melanctons,</hi> three hundred <hi>Bullingers,</hi> four hundred <hi>Martyrs,</hi> five hundred <hi>Calvins,</hi> they have yet noted more then twenty erroneous Articles, unto which they add this, <hi>hic Magiſter non tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:63874:84"/>who ſo holy as to underſtand his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal errors? no man ever ſearched the gulf of corruption in his own heart to the bottom, no man ever fully meaſured the breadth of the pure Law; there are in the beſt reliques of ſelf-love which cover a multitude of ſins, blinds of cuſtom, which hinder the ſight of ſin; what with carnal profits which blow duſt into our eyes, and what with carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which, becauſe brutiſh and beſtial, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reflection; there is a great deal of ſin unſeen to us, which is plain to the pure eyes of God. On the other ſide, where unknown ſins are obſtacles to reſignation, they are alſo obſtacles to faith; of which I ſhall give ſome inſtances. Some unknown ſins are therefore unknown becauſe they ariſe out of an Abyſs of darkneſs, out of a groſs ignorance of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals in the heart, and ſo in reſpect of their origine are inconſiſtent with faith, whoſe origine is light, ſuch ignorant ones cannot reſign; ſin to them, becauſe unknown, is no burden; holineſs to them, becauſe unknown, is no beauty; Chriſt and grace to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unknown, are no attractives; and how can they reſign? <hi>reſign recumbentially</hi> they cannot, for they know not the <hi>promiſes;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign <hi>obedientially</hi> they cannot, for they know not the <hi>precepts;</hi> reſign in an <hi>humble docible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> they cannot, for they know not ſo much as their want of <hi>knowledge.</hi> Again, ſome ſins, though unknown, carry in the matter of them a direct repugnancy to reſignation and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63874:85"/>ſo to faith. For inſtance, every man hath ſome natural Popery in his heart, he would be juſtified by a righteouſneſs of his own. The <hi>Jews</hi> being asked, whether they believed to be ſaved by Chriſts righteouſneſs, made this anſwer, <hi>every fox muſt pay his own skin to the flayer,</hi> every man muſt ſtand upon his own righteouſneſs; he that doth thus, need not, cannot reſign to Chriſts righteouſneſs: he need not, for why ſhould he go out of doors for a righteouſneſs which he hath within in his own heart; and he cannot, for juſtification by our own righteouſneſs and juſtification by Chriſts are contraries, and ſo are a dependance on our own righteouſneſs for juſtification, and a dependance on Chriſts for it. Hence the Jews, when they went about, though ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, could not believe, <hi>they ſubmitted not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. their own unreſigned righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs kept them from believing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the very matter of it contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Moreover, ſome ſins, which may not be known for fins in the matter of them, may yet be darlings, <hi>Delilahs,</hi> and as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word imports, <hi>exhauſters,</hi> ſuch as drain out the very marrow of the heart; I mean, the prime love, choice deſire, and ſupream delight thereof. Theſe in reſpect of their intimate conjunction with the ſoul are barrs to reſignation, and ſo to faith. <hi>How can ye believe which receive honour one of another?</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:63874:85"/>ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.44. their darling vain-glory made their believing impoſſible: After the ſame manner all lawful things, when once they are ſet up as Idols in the heart, and the love and the joy dance before them, are obſtacles to faith; thus we find, <hi>They would not come to the marriage-ſupper of the Goſpel;</hi> and why? their darling <hi>farms and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe kept them away, Math.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Haec vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, hae catenae quae carnales conſtringunt;</hi> theſe are the bonds and the chains which keep men from reſignation, and the more dangerouſly, becauſe they lie inviſible and hid among the ſtuſt of our lawful things. <hi>Chriſt and earthly things</hi> (ſaith a Great Divine) <hi>come often in competition, in every unjuſt gain, Chriſt and a bribe; in every oath, Chriſt and a blaſphemy; in every ſinful faſhion, Chriſt and a rag or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement; in every piece of vain-glory, Chriſt and a blaſt; in every intemperance, Chriſt and a vomit:</hi> whatever the thing be in it ſelf, lawful or ſinful, as ſoon as it becomes the Idol of the heart, it proves an obſtacle to faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, All known actual ſins are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute barrs to reſignation, and ſo not to faith:</hi> there are <hi>peccata quotidianae incurſionis,</hi> ſins of meer infirmity, ſuch as are not the proper formal iſſues of deliberation, but the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>effluviums</hi> of humane frailty; theſe may be in a man, and may be known to be in him, and yet through grace he may reſign, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe black moats ſlying round
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63874:86"/>about him, his faith may look up to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat; on the other ſide, known actual ſin iſſuing out of deliberation, if it be but in one ſingle act, doth, whileſt it is acting, put a barr to reſignation, and ſo to faith, for that ſingle act is rebellion, and how can a man, whileſt he is knowingly in arms againſt God, reſign? <hi>it is as the ſin of witchcraft,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. and how can a man, who is virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in covenant with the devil, enter into terms with God? that faith is not truly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbential,</hi> which is not alſo <hi>obediential,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it, can it, indeed lean upon Gods grace, whileſt his holineſs is rejected. And if ſuch known deliberate ſin in one ſingle act put a bar to faith, much more will it do ſo when it is in a courſe and ſeries of ſucceſſive rebellions. Thus St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>whoſoever ſinneth,</hi> that is, makes a trade and runs a courſe of known ſin, <hi>hath not ſeen him,</hi> that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who was manifeſted to take away ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. ſuch an one, though never ſo full of Scriptural notions, never yet ſaw a crucified Chriſt by faith, never yet looked upon the right mercy-ſeat, never yet ſet foot on the precious promiſes of the Goſpel; <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> cannot be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, for Chriſt is a holy Chriſt, a Chriſt upon his throne, and the trader in ſin is a <hi>man of Belial,</hi> a man (as the Hebrew word imports) <hi>abſque jugo,</hi> who caſts off the holy yoke from his heart and life.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:63874:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, That faith ſtands in reſignation, may appear from the act of reſignation made by faith.</hi> Faith in <hi>Enoch</hi> reſigned up his life, and in a ſpiritual ſenſe every believer is by faith tranſlated; <hi>Enoch-like</hi> he is not in the lower world, but ſo far as he believes, taken up by God and converſing in heaven. Faith in <hi>Abraham</hi> reſigned up his only one, his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and every believer, every child of <hi>Abraham</hi> treads in the ſame ſteps of faith, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into <hi>Moriah</hi> into <hi>the viſion of God,</hi> and there offering up the only one of the heart, the darling love and joy there. Faith in <hi>Moſes</hi> reſigned up <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in that reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up all the world, for in doing thereof his eye was not on ſome other part of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world, but <hi>on the inviſible God;</hi> and in every believer faith takes the world and caſts it behind his back as dung and droſs for the excellency of Chriſt, <hi>regard not your ſtuff,</hi> ſaith faith, <hi>all the Land of promiſe, a heaven of glory is before you:</hi> wonderful are the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders which faith makes in the believer, it ſurrenders up his underſtanding to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational myſteries. Meer reaſon goes no farther then its own ſphear of natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the line of faith runs as far as ſupernatural myſteries, ſuch as the <hi>lingua lutea,</hi> the clay tongue of man cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuch as <hi>lippus oculus,</hi> the weak eye of reaſon cannot ſee. Again, it ſurrenders up his will to ſuper-moral ſelf-denials. The Moraliſts ſelf-denial is but the artifice of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63874:87"/>his reaſon, but the believers is a very great myſtery. The Moraliſt denies only the beaſt, the brutiſh luſts in his ſenſitive affections, but the believer denies the more fine and ſpiritual fins in the Will it ſelf. The Moraliſts deſign is only to advance the Empire of Reaſon over the lower faculties, but the believers is to advance God and his holy Will over himſelf, and all that is in him. Moreover, it ſurrenders up his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to ſuper-ſenſual joyes and pleaſures: The Senſualiſt is for the Paradiſe of ſenſe, but the believer for the Paradiſe of God: The Senſualiſt ſwills in brutiſh pleaſures, and ſports himſelf with the volatile joyes of the fleſh, but the believer is upon the wing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the joyes of the ſpirit, and the pure ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of pleaſure above. In a word, faith is virtually all the reſignations which are in <hi>intellectual humiliations, inward mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>outward martyrdomes.</hi> In <hi>intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al humiliations,</hi> faith makes reaſon, though a Queen in her own dominions, come down and ſit at the foot of revelation. In <hi>inward mortifications,</hi> faith makes the regnant luſt come off from the throne of the heart, and bids the believer, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Captains, put his feet on the neck of his luſt. In <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward martyrdomes,</hi> faith hath empowred men to kiſs the ſtake, and embrace the flames, and cry out, as the bleſſed Martyr did, <hi>welcome ſweet croſs of Chriſt;</hi> and which is the crown of all the reſt, in all theſe reſignations <hi>faith
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63874:87"/>ventures all upon the bare word of God,</hi> and deſires no better ſecurity then that for all its expectations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, That faith ſtands in reſignation, may appear from the ſcope of Religion.</hi> It is the very center of all Divinity, and grand axiom therein, <hi>that the creature is to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and God exalted, no fleſh muſt glory in it ſelf, but in the Lord,</hi> all pride muſt be ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and boaſting cut off, that God may be all in all, and the creature nothing. Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, nor can be more accommodate to this <hi>Central Divinity,</hi> then faith, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion of reſignation; which I ſhall ſhew in the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This doth exceedingly abaſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Reſignation is the loweſt poſture of a creature, and ſo the fitteſt to take in all thoſe graces which the Goſpel hath entailed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Would you have <hi>adoption from God? leave thine own kindred and thy fathers houſe,</hi> ſtand not upon thy birth-right or parentage, which in a child of wrath, ſuch as thou art by nature, is as baſe and low as hell it ſelf; go forth to Chriſt the natural ſon of God, that thou mayeſt be an adopted one. Would you have <hi>pardon and juſtification?</hi> ſtay not at home in <hi>thine own righteouſneſs and repentant tears,</hi> theſe will not be habitable, when God comes in the pure glory of his juſtice and holineſs, go out and put on the glorious righteouſneſs of Chriſt, go out and lye down at the door
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63874:88"/>of the pardon-office. <hi>I, I am he that blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. Would you have <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces?</hi> thine own Will cannot teem them out, thine own power cannot form them. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> the Philoſopher, ſpent fifty years in making the Statue of a man ſo, as that with Engines it could ſpeak articulately, but when all was done, it was but a poor dead thing. Shouldeſt thou live the age of <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelah,</hi> and all the while in the artifice of thy reaſon, and power of thy will, labour to forge out true holinſs, it would be at laſt but an <hi>umbra,</hi> a dead ſhadow of grace, though it might ſpeak fairly in the way of notions and gifts, yet it would be without the heavenly life and vitality; thou muſt therefore yield up thy ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, that his ſpirit may come upon thee, and form the new-creature in thee; the ſum of all is this, <hi>put off thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, that God may know what to do unto thee, yield, reſign, be in the loweſt poſture of a creature, that all the Evangelical graces may be thine own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, This doth highly exalt God,</hi> and that in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, It exalts the mercy of God.</hi> Now it appears that mercy in its propoſals of ſalvation comes down to the very loweſt terms; it will adopt, juſtifie, and ſanctifie an yielding ſinner, and how can it poſſibly go lower? ſhould he adopt ſuch as will not ſuffer him to draw his picture upon their hearts? when
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63874:88"/>
                  <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> was for his Martial merits made <hi>Earl of the Empire,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaid, <hi>that her ſheep ſhould not be ſtamped</hi> alieno ſtigmate, <hi>with another mans mark;</hi> as long as men will keep the worlds and Satans mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, God cannot tell how to call them ſons; <hi>can he juſtifie the ungodly?</hi> to juſtifie the ungodly repenting and reſigning is his infinite grace, but to juſtifie them hardning and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is impoſſible to his holineſs, <hi>ſhould be count them pure with the wicked balances, Mic.</hi> 6.11. every unreſigned ſinner hath a wicked balance in his heart, which makes as if a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſinful pleaſure did outweigh God himſelf, and can he juſtifie ſuch wicked ones? ſhould the ſanctifying ſpirit with all its train of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, come and dwell in the unclean ſtable of indulged luſts? Chriſt the holy one of God was in his admirable humility in a ſtable of beaſts, but in a ſtable of indulged luſts he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; he dwells in the heart by faith, that is, in the reſigning heart, and it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: Mercy it ſelf, if it comport with the juſtice and holineſs of God, cannot make lower terms then to ſave the yielding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, It exalts the wiſdom of God.</hi> He hath ſo admirably contrived the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that mercy ſhall ſtoop to the loweſt terms, and the creature take it in the loweſt poſture, that ſo mercy might ſit in majeſty, and ſave in ſtate: Princes uſe in their acts of mercy to give an allay of Majeſty, ſuch as may
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63874:89"/>ſtand with their honour. <hi>Solomon</hi> will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Adonijah,</hi> but he muſt be <hi>a worthy man,</hi> or as the Original is, <hi>a ſon of virtue,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.52. <hi>King Henry the fourth of France</hi> would have freely pardoned <hi>Birone,</hi> but then he muſt make an ingenious confeſſion of the treaſon, which he neglecting to do in time, loſt his head. The great God gives out mercy to poor ſinners, but they muſt take it upon the knee, in a bending and reſigning poſture, ſuch as is congruous to ſo infinite a Majeſty; they muſt be put into ſelf-emptying and ſelf-annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thoughts, as <hi>Moſes</hi> into the clift of the rock, while the glory of free-grace paſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, It exalts the veracity of God.</hi> The believer reſigns up his ſoul, himſelf, his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, his all upon the meer word of God, giving him the glory of his truth in every tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. What <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, when he bad him let down his net, <hi>Maſter we have toiled all night and have taken nothing, yet at thy word I will let down the net, Luke</hi> 5.5. that ſaith the believer unto God, Lord, I am toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dark, under ſin and wrath, but at thy word I will caſt my ſelf upon free-grace; I am labouring under ſpiritual wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, but at thy word I will repair to the great treaſures of grace in Chriſt, ſtill <hi>the hangs upon a word:</hi> its true, he reſigns up himſelf to Chriſt and free-grace, but his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for doing ſo is a meer word; how doth he know that the infinite Ocean of mercy,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63874:89"/>whoſe effluxes are free, will flow out to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men? how doth he know that the Son of God was incarnate and ſuffered on a croſs for them? why, the word is nigh him, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe heavenly myſteries unto his heart; ſtill he hangs upon a word, that, if we make a true ſearch, lies at the very bottom of all his faith, as the foundation thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, It exalts the juſtice of God.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Rabbies have been caught by the head in the Controverſal thickets, whileſt they have diſputed about Gods juſtice in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning impotent men. Not to enter into the briers; there ſeems to be much in this, that God condemns none for <hi>bare impotency,</hi> but for <hi>height and pride and contumacy</hi> in that eſtate. Chriſts queſtion to the impotent man is very remarkable, <hi>wilt thou be made whole, Joh.</hi> 5.6. O thou impoten man, if thou art ſenſibly weak in thy impotency, poor in thy poverty, and low in thy low eſtate, ſurely creating grace is paſſing upon thee; but if thou art ſtrong in thy impotency, rich in thy poverty, and high in thy low eſtate, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is juſt; becauſe in the pride of thy heart thou wilt not yield to be ſaved on the terms of the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Spondand.

               <argument>
                  <p>Precious Faith confiuered in the fruits and glorious progreſſes of it; and here firſt, of the Divine Sagacities of Faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THUS far I have treated of Pretious Faith, in its firſt and loweſt meaſure, as it is the condition of the Goſpel, conſiſting of ſupernatural illumination, a belief of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimony, and a dependant reſignation to the terms of the Goſpel. Now I come to conſider the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>glorious progreſſes</hi> of faith. Faith is like <hi>Rebecca,</hi> the Mother of thouſands. That bleſſing of <hi>Abraham, in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee,</hi> falls down upon all the ſeed of believers; their faith is bleſſed with a fair progeny of graces and comforts, only theſe are not born all at once, for though adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and juſtification immediately enſue upon faith, comforts and ſtatures of graces do not do ſo, but come forth into being gradually, in ſome ſooner, in ſome later, as grace is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and as God is pleaſed to diſpenſe them: wherefore what I ſhall lay down touching the fruits of faith, I intend not as univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to all believers at the very
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63874:93"/>firſt, and before a progreſs made in grace, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and adoption are found in every believer, nay, and ſome meaſures of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but higher degrees of grace and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of Divine Love are not ſo; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I mean critically to time, when each holy fruit buds forth but only to explain the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall firſt begin with <hi>the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacities of Faith.</hi> There hath been a great ſtir in the world about wiſdom; <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have hunted after it; the <hi>Jews</hi> have vainly cried up themſelves, <hi>nos ſapientes, we are the wiſe men,</hi> ſay they; but in truth the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sage under the Sun is the believer. Upon Gods own ſurvey it was found, that <hi>there is none that underſtandeth, Rom.</hi> 3.11. none but the believer only, his knowledge is divine, all Arts and Sciences are but toyes to it, which occaſioned the worthy <hi>Pitiſcus</hi> to ſay, <hi>that he played in Mathematicks with his rule and compaſs, but he ſweat in Divinity;</hi> his deſign is the wiſeſt, he ſeeks a crown, a kingdom of glory: the Primitive Chriſtians were wont to talk ſo much of the kingdom, the kingdom, that the Pagan Emperors grew jealous of them; but alaſs, their aims were much higher, in compariſon whereof earthly Monarchs do but play at puſh-pin about Crowns of duſt, and ſpend their time like <hi>Domitian</hi> in catching flies; the believer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the world behind his back, pitches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heaven, and God, the heaven of heaven,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63874:93"/>in him to enjoy <hi>mirrors of truths, Sabbaths of love, rivers of pleaſures, and plenitudes of joy and bliſs for ever;</hi> and what wiſer deſign can enter into mans heart? ſurely none, as the laſt day will demonſtrate, when it ſhall put an eternal bluſh on all other deſigns. And as his end is the wiſeſt, ſo his way to it is the ſureſt, he goes to it by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>merit</hi> as a golden key unlocks the doors of bliſs to the believer, and whoſe <hi>ſpirit</hi> attires him with all graces to make him fit to enter in, and all this is not a fancy, a fools Paradiſe, but a truth, a real thing, founded on that infallible word, which ſtands faſter then the pillars of heaven and earth. But to unfold the ſagacities of faith more fully, I ſhall conſider them with relation to ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to God, the believer ſees the inviſible one,</hi> and that after another rate then meer Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts and Notionaliſts do, he hath more then a bare notion, he hath <hi>the myſtery of God in his heart,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. he that hath but the meer notion ſees him afar off, and knows not how to ſanctifie ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in his heart, no more then <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> did, who firſt in an excellent Oration before the <hi>French King</hi> proved there there was a God, and then being much applauded by the Auditory, offered the next day to prove the contrary, but he that hath the myſtery, ſees him neer at hand, and ſo prepares a room for him in his heart; a fear for his Majeſty,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63874:94"/>a love for his goodneſs, a faith for his truth and mercy, a joy for his ſalvation, putting each affection into a poſture ſuteable to ſome one or other of his Divine Attributes: he that hath but a notion of Gods Omnipreſence, can ſport with his ſins, as if there were no God in the place, but he that hath the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, <hi>Abraham-like, walks before God, on to his faces,</hi> as the Original is, <hi>Gen,</hi> 17.1. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where there is a face of God appearing, to deter him from ſin, and excite him to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he that hath but a notion of Gods grace, hath no favour, no reliſh of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof; which I ſuppoſe makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of ſome great Scholars as dry and ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as <hi>Cardinal Pools</hi> Sermon about the Pall; but he that hath the myſtery of it, <hi>taſts how gratious the Lord is,</hi> and is raviſhed, as if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened, and ſome drops from the rivers of pleaſure there, were let down upon his heart; he that hath but a notion of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, can ſit in his luſts before the ſparks of his own kindling, and be no more afraid at the threatnings in Scripture, then <hi>Jehojakim</hi> was at the burning of the roll, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.24. one luſt or other conſumes all the roll of Divine threatnings, but he that hath the myſtery of it cannot do ſo; to him hell flames out in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very threatning, he <hi>trembles at the word,</hi> and ſaith, O my ſoul, be not deceived, <hi>if thou live after the fleſh, thou wilt dye, if thou ſow unto the fleſh, thou muſt reap corruption.</hi> He that hath but a notion of Gods power, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63874:94"/>Gods hand in ſmall croſſes, juſt as the proud <hi>Greeks,</hi> who when <hi>Callipolis</hi> was loſt, ſaid <hi>the Turks had taken but a bottle of wine;</hi> but he that hath the myſtery of it dares not do ſo, well knowing that the lighteſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions come from <hi>Shaddai, the Almighty,</hi> and if need be, he can ſtrike harder; he that hath but a notion of Gods All-ſufficiency, hath his affections ſcattered up and down the earth, as the poor <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were over <hi>Egypt</hi> for ſtraw, to gather, if it were poſſible, a happineſs from the flowers of the creature; but he that hath the myſtery of it, knows how by a compendious wiſdom to have all in God; roll over all worlds, the world of thoughts wiſhes and deſires in the heart, the world of riches honours and pleaſures in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the world of pardons graces and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in Saints, the world of joy glory and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in heaven; and after all this, the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can tell you, all theſe are to be found in God, <hi>habet omnia, quihabet habentem omnid,</hi> after this manner the ſecret of the Lord is with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to Jeſus Chriſt, the believer hath the myſtery of him in his heart.</hi> A man may have a notion of <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have an heart of fleſh, an yielding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning heart for God to manifeſt his ſpirit and graces in, that the heart may in ſome meaſure be made anſwerable to the ſpirit and graces in Chriſt, he wants the myſtery of it. St. <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking of love, ſaith, <hi>which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63874:95"/>thing is true in him and in you,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.8. Why ſo? becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>the darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth;</hi> a man may tell the ſtory of the meekneſs, humility, holineſs, obedience, charity, patience it Chriſt; but if the true light do not ſhine in him by faith, if theſe graces be not true in Chriſt: and in him, he hath not the myſtery thereof; the ſpyes coming back from <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> brought not only a bare report of the good Land, but <hi>cluſters of grapes alſo;</hi> he that hath the myſtery of Chriſt, hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a meer notion of the full treaſures of grace in him, but <hi>cluſters of graces</hi> from thence as ſo many real proofs thereof; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth notably decipher this ſagacity, <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death, Phil</hi> 3.10. If a man hath only a notion of Chriſt crucified and Chriſt riſen, we may character him as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> did the Monaſtery he was in there is <hi>nihil Chriſti,</hi> nothing of Chriſt cruciſied, where luſts are living and reigning, nothing of Chriſt riſen, where the ſoul is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; he only knows the <hi>fellowſhip of Chriſts ſufferings,</hi> who hangs up his earthly members on the croſs to dye and expire; the only knows the <hi>power of Chriſts reſurrection,</hi> who hath felt the ſame Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power which raiſed up Chriſt, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſoul to a heavenly life: this is the myſtery, the <hi>ſo learning of Chriſt,</hi> as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63874:95"/>is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20. learning him ſo, as <hi>to put off the old man with his corrupt luſts,</hi> and <hi>to put on the new man in true holineſs,</hi> and ſo, as <hi>to be found in him, and count all droſs and dung for him:</hi> It deeply concerns all Chriſtians, nay, the greateſt Clerks to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this <hi>(ſo)</hi> which without faith no man doth, as being void of Chriſt and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>As to inherent grace, the believer knows it to be an excellent thing, an accident more worth then the ſubſtance of the ſoul it ſelf, and yet withall he knows it to be a creature, and in it ſelf defectible, he knows it to be an excellent thing excellent in its ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parentage, a thing <hi>not born of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> an holy thing formed by the overſhadowing of the bleſſed ſpirit, a beam of grace from the eternal grace in the heart of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent again as it is the ſouls loſtre, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its glaſs, humility its vail, obedience its golden ear-ring, love the chain of its neck, righteouſneſs its fine linnen, every grace its inward glory and beauty, elevating natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties above their own pitch, into a ſtate congruous for communion with God, above all, excellent as it repreſents God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in every creature there is a <hi>print</hi> or <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of God,</hi> but in grace there is his very <hi>image and reſemblance.</hi> a believer can ſee more of God in an holy beam, then in the great Sun, in a little of heaven, then in all the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63874:96"/>earth, intal poor meek ſpirit, then in all the <hi>Nimrods</hi> and mighty Potentates of the world; and yet after all this, the believer ſees grace to be but a creature, and in it ſelf defectible without a ſpiritual concourſe from heaven, ſhould God bid him ſtand alone, he would be in an agony, and pray as) <hi>Annas Burgus</hi> did at his Martyrdome, <hi>Deus mi, ne me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relinquas, ne ego te derelinquam, my God, forſake me not, leſt I forſake thee.</hi> Should God offer him all the Angels in heaven to guard his little ſpark of grace in being, he would tremble and ſay, not ſo Lord, let me be <hi>kept by thine Almighty power unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is the only keeper I deſire; he dares not ſay, <hi>my mountain is ſtrong, now I am full, now I am rich, now I reign as a King by my ſelf;</hi> were he full of grace, it would be but as a room is of light, no ſooner could he ſhut the windows, and poſſeſs it in a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſiſtence, but he would be in the dark, and experiment every beam to hang upon the Sun of righteouſneſs; were he rich in grace, it would be but as a Merchant is in his trade, if the rich returns from heaven ſhould fail, he would ſoon ſpend all his ſtock, and like a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> turn bankrupt; were he a ſpiritual King ruling over his luſts, he would and muſt confeſs himſelf under the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and to hold all his power from thence, or elſe <hi>Mene, Mene, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is numbred,</hi> and divided among luſts and devils. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I live,</hi> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63874:96"/>he calls it back again, <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. well knowing that all his grace had its being from the true <hi>Immanuel, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and its continuance from the continual influxes of his ſpirit, which are in a ſober ſenſe a kind of <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> ſtrengthening graces where they are weak, quickning where they are dead, upholding where they are falling, and by an inceſſant ſpiration influencing Being into them, that they may not vaniſh into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>As to the oppoſite, ſin, the believer ſees more of the <hi>ſinfulneſs of ſin,</hi> and yet more of <hi>the holy God</hi> about it then others do. He ſees more of the <hi>ſinfulneſs of ſin</hi> then others. Next to Chriſt, who weighed ſin upon the croſs, he of all men knows beſt how to weigh it; the natural man may put in the breach of the Law into the ſcale, but he puts in all the bloody aggravations, the ſuffocated light, and abuſed love, the quenchings of the ſpirit, and the rejections of Chriſt, the broken vows and lying promiſes of obedience, the ſtabs of conſcience, and warning pieces of wrath, the meaſures of delight and obſtinacy in ſin, and the heaps of guilt in reiterated ſinning, no man makes ſin ſo ſinful as he; the pure light of faith being up in the heart, every ſcarlet thread in the contexture thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes viſible; and yet after all this, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſees more of <hi>the holy God</hi> about it then others do, and that whether he look on the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63874:97"/>ſins of others, or his own. As to other mens, we have many examples in Scripture; the meſſengers that came to <hi>Job,</hi> ſpake of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> oppreſſion, but <hi>the Lord hath taken away,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Job, Job</hi> 1.21. when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed <hi>David, Abiſhai</hi> looks no further then <hi>Shimei, why ſhould this dead dog curſe my Lord the King?</hi> ſaith he, but what ſaith heavenly <hi>David, the Lord hath ſaid unto him, curſe David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.9, 10. In the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> carnal men looked only at the inſtruments, ſuch as <hi>Pilate</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were, but the Saints ſaw <hi>Gods hand and Gods counſel</hi> in it, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28. As to his own ſins, there is a famous inſtance in the Churches complaint, <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to err from thy wayes? and hardned our heart from thy fear? Iſa.</hi> 63.17. What? were they not ſenſible that the error and hardneſs were their own? yes doubtleſs, they were more ſenſible then others, as appears by their mourning and longing for the Lords return, yet they cry out, <hi>why haſt thou made us to err? and why haſt thou hardned us?</hi> the believer when he looks upon providence and ſin, hath a ſpiritual ſagacity to determine the matter. God is holy, while man is unclean; God wiſe, while man fooliſh; God merciful, while man cruel: the light is Gods, and the darkneſs mans; the order Gods, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxy mans; the juſtice Gods, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs mans. As to <hi>Satan,</hi> the believer knows him by the word more truly then all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63874:97"/>the <hi>Magitians</hi> in the world; when <hi>Satan</hi> ſhews himſelf in Magical apparitions, he doth but mock the ſenſe and delude the mind, but when God ſhews him forth in the word, he appears in his proper colours and true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the believer knows him to be of very great power, <hi>a ruler of darkneſs, a Prince,</hi> nay <hi>a God of this world,</hi> one that can do great things without in the elements, and within in the paſſions, a mighty <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who can make the heart boil as a pot and foam out its own ſhame, and withall he knows that this roaring Lyon is in a chain, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go beyond his commiſſion. Again, the believer knows him to be <hi>an old ſerpent</hi> full of methods and deviſes, turning every ſtone, waiting upon every occaſion, complying with every temper, and putting on every ſhape; in his temptations, now in the dreſs and pomp of earthly things, and then in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels Mantle, transforming himſelf into an Angel of light;</hi> ſometimes carrying men up into <hi>the mountain</hi> of the world, and glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanity before them; and ſometimes ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them on <hi>a pinacle of the Temple,</hi> to caſt them down by the pride of their own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; now ſpeaking in the Language of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Maſter ſpare thy ſelf,</hi> and anon in the Language of Scripture, <hi>it is written</hi> thus and thus, and all that he may <hi>devour,</hi> or, as it is in the Original, <hi>drink up,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>ſouls,</hi> as if he lived upon ſpirits, and no blood would ſerve him but that of ſouls: And
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63874:98"/>withall the believer knows, that the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God can wrap up Satan in his own nets, and countermine him in every plot, he can awaken us out of the ſnare, and make us ſee the methods and ſubtile poſtures of the devil, how he would charm us into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or roar us into deſpair; how he ſtands at our right hand in holy duties, and at our left in earthly employments; what <hi>a murderer</hi> he is in ſtifling holy motions, and what a lyar in his falſe joyes and promiſes: Thus the believer knows more of Satan and his helliſh depths then others do.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>things paſt,</hi> the believer hath a holy ſagacity to make a good improvement of them, which is moſt evident in his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating Scripture-hiſtories to himſelf, in ſuch or ſuch a ſtate (ſaith he) God dealt ſo or ſo in a way of mercy or juſtice, and if I come into that ſtate, I ſhall have the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe God is ever the ſame, and his mercy and juſtice have the ſame aſpects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men as heretofore; the believer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates good ſtates and good conſequents: ſee in what way the goodneſs of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch a man, in the very ſame way will it be with me, ſaith faith; if I can ſtrive and wreſtle with God in prayer, I am in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſtate, and ſhall be a <hi>prince with God; the effectual fervent prayer. of the righteous man availeth much, James</hi> 5.16. if I am in <hi>Joſhuaes</hi> ſtate, fighting againſt luſts the true
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63874:98"/>Canaanites, <hi>God will never never leave me nor forſake me,</hi> that was a particular promiſe made to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> yet is by the Apoſtle accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to believers, as being in his ſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. If a man ſuffer for the true God and his worſhip, he is in <hi>the fiery furnace,</hi> and <hi>the ſon of God</hi> is with him to comfort and ſupport him, if he have a good conſcience made ſo by the blood and ſpirit of Chriſt, he is in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and ſhall never drown in the common perdition, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. there is <hi>a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> in which faith obſerves righteouſneſs going before, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy following after. Again, the believer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates bad ſtates and bad conſequents, ſee in what way Gods wrath brake out againſt ſuch a man, in the ſame way will it break out againſt me, ſaith faith; if I am murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and unbelieving, I am in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtate, and without repentance <hi>I ſhall dye in the wilderneſs and never enter into reſt;</hi> if I wallow in the mire of groſs and ſenſual ſins, I am in <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and may expect their line of plagues and eternal fire: if <hi>I love the wages of righteouſneſs,</hi> I am in <hi>Balaams</hi> way, and may look for his end; if I ſleep in my indulged luſt, I am in <hi>Delilahs lap,</hi> and like to loſe my own ſtrength and Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; theſe are our <hi>types or figures,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. in which we have a lively image and pourtraiture of puniſhments for ſin, and from thence may by faith divine, that if ſuch ſins
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63874:99"/>goes before, ſuch wrath will follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>preſent world,</hi> which is checker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good and evil things, and hath in it, as the Ark had of old, <hi>a rod and a pot of Manna,</hi> the believer hath a greater ſagacity then others. <hi>As to the good things of the world,</hi> no man ſees ſo much of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and withall no man ſees ſo much of their vanity as the believer doth; take the world in its own place and ſtation, and thus it is a rare monument of the eternal power and Godhead, the inviſible ſpirit renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf viſible, and as it were palpable in it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very being in nature ſhews forth <hi>the Being of Beings,</hi> every beam of light points to <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights,</hi> every drop of goodneſs leads to the great Ocean, every harmony among the creatures tells of an infinite Artificer: this is the ſenſe of the creation, which faith underſtands better then learning. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and great Naturaliſts may ſee <hi>more of the creature</hi> then the believer, but the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſees <hi>more of God</hi> in it then they; they gaze moſt on the fine letters and characters in nature, but he beſt knows the ſenſe of all, which is God. On the other ſide, take the world into the heart, and there exalt it as the ſupream good of man, and thus it is a lye, a fancy, a dream, a ſhadow, my, a very nothing; after all its goodly promiſes, it is but a lye; after all its ſpreading pomp and glory, it is but much
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63874:99"/>fancy, it caſts men into dreams and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of happineſs in this and that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but as ſoon as faith awakens them, it is known to be but a dream, the day break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the heart, all the ſhadows flee away, it looks like ſomewhat of ſubſtance, but it is as all other Idols are, <hi>a meer nothing,</hi> nothing to make a God of, nothing as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from its Creator, juſt as letters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe, and beams without a Sun, perfect vanity, which (as a Learned man hath it) <hi>is in its true Idea made up of nothing as the matter, and a lye as the form thereof.</hi> A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man gazes upon riches, and forgets <hi>the thorn;</hi> clothes himſelf with the creature, and forgets <hi>the moth;</hi> drinks of the cup of pleaſures, as if there were no poiſon in it, and ſits under the gourd of worldly things as if there were <hi>no worm at the root;</hi> but the believer ſees a vanity in the faireſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of the world, before the ruſt appears viſibly in the gold, faith ſees it there; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Dooms-day daſhes down the world actually, faith doth it mentally, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as inconſiderable a nothing to mans happineſs, as it will ſenſibly appear at laſt, when the whole ſhall be wrapt up in a winding-ſheet of flames. Again, though the carnal man dote more on creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts then the believer, yet the believer pries more curiouſly about them then he; the carnal man is all for the bulk, but the believer not ſo much for that, ſearches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63874:100"/>the title, he would very fain have what he hath <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt, and in the good will of God.</hi> Since ſin blaſted and forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world, he dares not claim any thing upon meer creation, but all in and through Chriſt and free-grace, <hi>all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. there's his title; the carnal man looks on the world as a mountain of prey, and ſcrambles for as much of it as he can, but the believer would have every grain come through <hi>Joſephs</hi> hands, and all his bread and wine ſet forth by the true <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck, the King of righteouſneſs;</hi> nay, ſuch is his holy curioſity, that he is jealous of the leaſt adherent guilt, which others never mind; the oppreſſing Merchant boaſts and ſmooths up himſelf, <hi>yet I am become rich, I have found me out ſubſtance, in all my labours there is no iniquity, Hoſ.</hi> 12.7, 8. but let faith come in, and then <hi>the ſtone cryes out of the wall, and the ruſt of the gold and ſilver witneſſes againſt him.</hi> There were in <hi>Saxony</hi> (as <hi>Thuanus</hi> relates) two ſordid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane wretches, who for filthy lucre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed a great quantity of corn, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards opening their barn-doors to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, the corn flew up into their eyes, driving them into horrid aſtoniſhment and deſperation: ſhould the believer oppreſs, it would flye in the face of conſcience, and the curſe of God would ſeize upon him; upon which account he is very curious about his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63874:100"/>eſtate, to keep the moth of guilt from it. <hi>As to the evil things of the world,</hi> ſuch as croſſes and afflictions, whileſt others pore only on the outward evil lying before the ſenſes, the believer looks upward to God the ſupream Moderator, being richly content with croſſes, as long as God governs the world. A ſtory there is of a godly but ſickly woman, who when an Angel came to her from God, proffering her as from him health in one hand, and ſickneſs in the other, fell a weeping, that God ſhould put her to her choice, and not himſelf chuſe for her; ſuch is the genius of faith, which would not chuſe for it ſelf, but refer all to God, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every croſs as a piece of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who rules the world. Again, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever looks inward to ſin, as the black foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence all miſeries iſſue forth in the world, well knowing that all Phyſical evils are but the pay of Moral; whileſt others cry out of the plagues, he complains of the ſins: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cries out <hi>perii,</hi> but <hi>David pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavi, Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, Pſal.</hi> 51.4. and there is great reaſon for it, becauſe ſin is the fontal evil, which powres out all other evils, and puts a deſperate ſting and venom into them. Moreover, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever looks forward to the iſſue of affliction, 'tis enough to others to come out of it, but he would come out of it as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did out of <hi>Egypt, with ſpinitual jewels and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;</hi> whileſt they tell over their outward
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63874:101"/>loſſes, he computes his inward gains. Oh! ſaith he, what hath God wrought by this croſs? did not faith roll out as pure gold out of a furnace? hath not the fire diſſolved ſome bands of corruption? how much of the ruſty world hath been filed off from the heart? hath not the rod it ſelf budded and bloſſomed with <hi>the peaceable fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?</hi> what experiments have been made of the love and faithfulneſs of God in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? which of the Promiſes came in to me, and milked out its comforts in my heart? how warm were the heavenly affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, when the froſt lay upon outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts? ſuch enquiries as theſe doth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever make after the holy fruit of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to things future and diſtant,</hi> the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath a notable ſagacity; the men of this world are wrapt up in the vail of time, and ſee not ſo far as futurity and eternity; but as ſoon as faith comes, it rents off the vail, and gives a fair proſpect into another world: if all the intermediate moments between this and the laſt day were cut off, dooms-day were actually upon us, faith can in a ſpiritual way put back all the middle time, and makes us ſee things as they will be, <hi>the heavens on fire, the elements melting with fervent heat, the laſt trumpet ſounding, the dead riſing out of the duſt and gathering to the grand Tribunal,</hi> faith is the <hi>preſentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of all theſe. <hi>Job</hi> looks through the worms
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63874:101"/>and duſt upon a reſurrection, <hi>my Redeemer liveth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. though I dye, my Redeemer liveth, and will fetch me up again; if there were an Engine made which could pull away all the intermediate bodies between us and the heaven of heavens, we might look into Paradiſe; faith doth the ſame thing ſpiritually, it puts by the world and time, and lies at the door of heaven and eternity. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>we look not at the things temporal, but at the eternal,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. he puts by all temporal things, which as the lower heavens hold back the face of Gods throne, and ſo he looks into eternity. There is a ſtory of an <hi>Oxford Monk,</hi> who by his skill in Magick conveyed himſelf into the Northern Regions, and there took a view of the Pole: the believer by the art of faith doth much more, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying himſelf out of this world, and taking a view of eternity; in the promiſes he ſees heaven opening, and letting down ſome ſparkles of glory; in the threatnings he ſees hell flaming, and ſome of the fire unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able breaking out, heaven and hell are no longer notions but ſenſations; in the raptures and joyes of faith he hath been <hi>caught up into Paradiſe,</hi> and there drunk of the wine of Angels, in convictions and deep humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he hath been as it were at Gods barr, and hanging over the bottomleſs pit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to ſeeming contradictions,</hi> the believer hath a rare dexterity to enucleate them.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63874:102"/>Touching which I ſhall give ſome inſtances. God commanded <hi>Abraham, offer up thy ſon, thine only ſon Iſaac,</hi> to offer up a ſon was a ſeeming contradiction to nature, to offer up an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a ſon of promiſe, was a ſeeming contradiction to Gods truth, who before had ſaid, <hi>in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> but faith unlocks all theſe difficulties, <hi>God is able to raiſe him up from the dead,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from thence <hi>he received him in a figure, Heb.</hi> 11.19. a parallel to this we may find in all true believers, the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> God calls upon them, <hi>mortifie the deeds of the body, and ye ſhall live;</hi> mortifie and live is a ſeeming contradiction, to offer up our only ones, our wills, our loves, our joys, to be ſlain, looks like a piece of unnaturalneſs; but what ſaith faith? it is no ſuch matter, offer up your only ones, your wills, your loves, your joys, unto God, and you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them again from the dead, raiſed up in the incorruption of the new-creature, that which was ſown a natural will, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral love, and natural joy, ſhall be raiſed up a ſpiritual will, ſpiritual love, and ſpiritual joy, your ſouls before dead in ſins, ſhall have the life of God in them, <hi>this is the firſt reſurrection;</hi> ſuch things as theſe nature laughs at as ſtrange paradoxes, but faith embraces as rare myſteries. Again, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſie and my burden is light, Math.</hi> 11.29, 30. what is Chriſts yoke but the Commandements? and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63874:102"/>are theſe portable by any meer man? ſo ſay the Romaniſts from this very place, but the miſtake is ſo groſs that the <hi>communis ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of Chriſtians runs againſt it; faith can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle it another way, the impoſſibles of the Law, the ſinleſs perfection unattainable by us were fulfilled by Chriſt, the heavy end of the Law, the dreadful curſe unavoidable by us was born by Chriſt, the Covenant of grace is ſatisfied with uprightneſs in the wayes of God, which is eaſie to a renewed man: its true, while there is only the preſſure of a Law without, and nothing but a natural heart of enmity within, the wayes of God are irkſom and tedious, which occaſioned a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine to ſay, <hi>that a man might take a carnal man, tye him to a table, and kill him with praying and preaching;</hi> but it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the believer, who ſerves God <hi>not in the oldneſs of the letter, but in the newneſs of the ſpirit,</hi> who hath a Law within anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law without, and a ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in prompting the ſame in the heart, which the ſpirit in the command doth outwardly dictate. Prayer is but the breathing of the new-creature, holy deſires its pulſe, holineſs its element, obedience its common walk, alms but the opening of its hands, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation but the lifting up of its eyes, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eaſie, becauſe from inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of life and grace: <hi>My yoke is eaſie, is durus ſermo, an hard ſaying to every man but to the believer,</hi> who does all ſweetly and

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to give another inſtance, <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. what ſtrange language is here? work, and yet God worketh all, and all of his meer pleaſure; how can theſe things be? if God work all, there ſeems to be no place left for virtue or vice, rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe man can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. O what ſweats have Learned brains been thrown into, whileſt they have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tune free-grace and free-will into har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? what craggy thorny Volumes of meer ſpeculation have they put forth <hi>de concordiâ liberi arbitrii &amp; gratiae?</hi> and after all is done, the believer underſtands it beſt of any man; his life of faith is a plain practical ſolution thereof, for he acts and moves, but under the firſt Agent and Mover; he works, but under the Maſter-workman; he is free, but under the free-making ſpirit; he ſpreads his ſails, and withall looks up for the holy gales; he labours and ſows precious ſeed, and at the ſame time waits for the ſpiritual dews and ſun-beams; he hath graces in him, but layes all under that ſpirit that created them, that that ſpirit may touch upon his charity and draw out his ſoul in alms, and touch upon his devotion, and pour out his ſoul in prayer, and touch upon every grace, and make the ſpices thereof flow out; ſtill he
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63874:104"/>waits for the touches of the ſpirit. Moral virtues, like the fabled cymbal of St. <hi>Teli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> may ſeem to ring alone by their own ſelf-power and ſelf-confidence, but ſpiritual graces, like <hi>Davids</hi> harp, muſt be awakened by divine influences; as it was in Chriſt on earth, the Humanity alwayes miniſtred to the Divinity, ſo it is with the believer, ſo far as his faith acts, all his faculties and graccs are but as it were ſo many gardens, aery rooms, and working-houſes for the holy ſpirit to walk, breath, and work its pleaſure in. Hence the believer is ſaid in Scripture to <hi>walk in the ſpirit, pray in the ſpirit, live in the ſpirit,</hi> doing all under the conduct thereof: after ſome ſuch ſort as this doth the believer <hi>work out his ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> in a way of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and holy dependance upon God, <hi>who worketh to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</hi> We have an eminent inſtance of this in holy <hi>David,</hi> ſee how he hangs upon God in the 119 <hi>Pſal. thou haſt commanded us to keep thy precepts,</hi> but <hi>O that my wayes were directed to do ſo, ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>I will keep thy ſtatutes,</hi> but <hi>O forſake me not utterly, ver.</hi> 8. with <hi>my whole heart have I ſought thee,</hi> but <hi>O let me not wander from thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ver.</hi> 10. <hi>I will run the way of thy commandements,</hi> but <hi>do thou enlarge my heart, ver.</hi> 32. <hi>I love thy precepts,</hi> but <hi>quicken me O Lord according to thy loving kindneſs, ver.</hi> 159. <hi>I have choſen thy precepts, O let thine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63874:105"/>hand help me, ver.</hi> 173. how working is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and how depending? how ſweetly do mans obedience and Gods influence accord together? this a believer practically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, and none but he: whileſt others labour to fathome it by ſpeculation, the myſtery is too deep for them, but the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath it practically and in experience every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to ſpiritual extractions,</hi> the believer is very ſagacious. Chymiſts by racking and torturing of nature, have forced her to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of many ſecrets and choice myſteries, which made <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſo triumph over <hi>Galen,</hi> vaunting proudly, that the <hi>leaſt hair of his head had more learning then all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities beſides.</hi> The believer is the beſt of Chymiſts, no extractions are like thoſe of faith, <hi>he extracts heaven out of earth;</hi> could a man extract gold out of baſe metals, it would be but earth out of earth, purer out of groſſer; but the believer extracts hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of earth. As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw more then meer <hi>Eſau,</hi> he ſaw <hi>Gods face</hi> in <hi>Eſaus,</hi> ſo the believer ſees more then the meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comfort, he ſees the goodneſs of God in it, which is the ſweetneſs of all. Carnal men are content with the bulk and groſs matter of an earthly bleſſing, but the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver draws out the ſpirits and quinteſcence thereof; that is, <hi>the love of God,</hi> without which oil and wine and corn, and all other earthly things are but a <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63874:105"/>piece of droſs and dead mattor in his eyes; earthly things are tranſient and periſhing in themſelves, but he hath an art to melt them down by charity into a fixed condition, though he cannot ſay, his houſe, yet he can, his charity ſhall continue for ever. Silver and gold will not go <hi>in ſpeeie,</hi> in the upper world, but he knows how by the poor, which are Chriſts bankers, to return them thither for <hi>everlaſting habitations,</hi> given in exchange by free-grace.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>he extracts good out of evil.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men ſee nothing in affliction but a lump of ſorrow, but the believer knows that there is a bleſſing in it, the ſharpneſs of it may let out his corruption, the ſuddenneſs of it may alarum his ſpiritual watch, the bitterneſs of it may wean him from the breaſt of the creature, the weight of it may try the back of his faith and patience; it is no longer meer trouble, but made out into fans to unchaff him of his vanity, into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces to reſine his golden graces, into moulds to caſt him into the image of a meek ſuffering Chriſt, into ſpiritual wings to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſoul in devotions and heavenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards the everlaſting reſt which is above: much of the love and faithfulneſs; of God is to be ſeen in it, which made <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſick of the peſtilence, to ſhew the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and plague-tokens on his arm <hi>ut armil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las &amp; precioſas Chriſti gemmas, as the brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and rich jewels of Chriſt;</hi> ſuch noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63874:106"/>can faith make out of ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if they were the only love-tokens to feal up a ſon of God; according to that old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Qui excipitur à numero flagellatorum, excipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à numero ſiliorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>he extracts ſtrength out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Satans ſhocks and the fluxes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruption may make him weak and ready to periſh, but his faith tells him that the power of God, which can do all things, is <hi>perfected in weakneſs,</hi> and the weakneſs of man under which he groans, is a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for that power to ſhew forth it ſelf in; when our power is gone, there is room for Gods, when there is no might, he increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſtrength, as it was in Chriſt, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the humane fleſh was anointed with the divinity; ſo it is in the believer, the weakneſs, the humane frailty is anointed with the power of grace; when he is weak in himſelf, then he is ſtrong in God; when weak in the fleſh, then ſtrong in the ſpirit. The Pſalmiſt hath ſome Pſalms upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalath,</hi> that is, upon inſtruments Muſical, ſay ſome, but upon infirmity, ſay others; the believer is able to glory and make Muſick over his weakneſſes, becauſe his faith can fetch down the power of God upon him, <hi>wait on the Lord and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart, Pſal.</hi> 27.14. as faith goes up, ſo power comes down; hence the believer <hi>out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is made ſtrong,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:63874:106"/>
               <p>Again, <hi>he extracts grace out of unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> well knowing that the way of grace is to move it ſelf into act from our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs; a notable inſtance whereof we have, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>ſhe went after her lovers, and forgate me, ſaith the Lord, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her;</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſhe is idolatrous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behold, I will be gracious. Oh what a ſtupendious <hi>therefore</hi> is here? deſervedly is it followed with a <hi>behold,</hi> a note of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: So wonderful it is, that ſome Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men among the Papiſts, not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſuch a connection could poſſibly be, have thought that it referrs not to that which immediately went before, but to ſome precedent words about the beginning of the Chapter; a parallel place to this we have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, 18. <hi>he went on frowardly in the way of his heart, I have ſeen his wayes and will heal him.</hi> Oh! what ſtrange grace is here? one would have thought he would have ſaid, he went on frowardly, I have ſeen his wayes, and will damn him, but it is, I have ſeen his wayes, and will heal him. Some Jewiſh Commentators gloſs it thus, I have ſeen his repenting wayes and will heal him. I ſuppoſe not underſtanding how grace ſhould immediately follow upon perverſneſs, but the believer knows that this is the method of grace, and therefore by an holy art preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for it even from his own unworthineſs,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63874:107"/>Our Saviour Chriſt calls the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman, crying out for mercy, no better then dog, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.26. a word of reproach, ſuch as the proud Jews put on all the Gentiles, ſuch as made the <hi>Saracens</hi> revolt from the <hi>Emperour Heraclius</hi> his army, and ſet up for themſelves, under their Captain <hi>Mahomet;</hi> but ſee how admirably her faith gathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and even from that word preſſes for mercy, <hi>truth Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their Maſters table, ver.</hi> 27. <hi>ipſum Dominum in verbis capit, ſhe takes the Lord in his own words,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ferus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her title to the crumbs from her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dog: Holy <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great, Pſal.</hi> 25.11. a ſtrange argument for pardon, for it is great, ſuch as no malefactor would uſe to an earthly Prince, but the holy man knows that it will paſs with God, who loves to make grace ſuperabound there, where ſin hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>he extracts hope out of deſpair.</hi> When he is ready to faint and ſwoon away in cold fits of ſpiritual deadneſs, faith revives and points him to the fountain of life, which runs over in quickning graces upon the whole Church; and if he ſcruple his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to that fountain, faith tells him, that the Well is open to all comers, <hi>whoſoever will may take of the water of life freely,</hi> whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath the bucket of faith may draw out of it; and if he yet reply, true, whoſoever
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63874:107"/>will may do ſo; but oh! I want a will, I want an heart for God and Chriſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, faith is able, if awakened, both to tell him, that theſe are living groans, and withall to drop ſome Scripture cordial into his heart, ſuch as that is <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. where Chriſt, the wiſdom of God, <hi>builds his houſe,</hi> the Church, <hi>kills his beaſts, mingles his wine, furniſhes his table,</hi> that is, provides all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bleſſings, <hi>ſends out his virgins,</hi> his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſters, and after all invites the <hi>ſimple,</hi> and <hi>him that wanteth underſtanding, to eat, of his bread and drink of his wine,</hi> in the Original it is, <hi>him that wanteth heart.</hi> Oh! if thou ſenſibly wanteſt an heart for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, here thou art particularly called to the Goſpel ſeaſt, where <hi>Chriſts fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood wine indeed,</hi> able to make thee live for ever.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>he extracts joy out of ſorrow.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced over the godly ſorrow of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> becauſe they received no damage in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. when faith looks over all the tears and groans of the believer, it ſaith there is no damage in theſe, theſe tears are bottled in heaven, the holy ſpirit breaths in thoſe groans, he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſheaves with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.6. Oh! ſaith faith, obſerve the word, doubtleſs tears and ſorrows in a godly ſort are a
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63874:108"/>ſure ſign that the harveſt of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is nigh at hand, one may ſee the crop in the ſeed ſown. When the <hi>Emperor Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> baniſhed <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Nubecula eſt, &amp; citò tranſibit, it is but a little cloud, and will ſoon be over;</hi> when the night of darkneſs and diſcomfort is upon the ſoul, faith is able to ſay, 'tis but a ſhort night of ſorrow, <hi>joyes come in the morning, Pſal.</hi> 30.5. and for that morning, I will truſt the ſun of righteouſneſs, O how ſoon can he make it day in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>he extracts wiſdome out of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> There is not, there cannot be any thing in all the world ſo fooliſh as ſin, and yet out of this he picks up wiſdom, hereby he comes to know more of his own heart. There is a Mahometan fable, that the heart of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> being a child, was cut open, and a black grain, called the devils portion, taken out of the midſt thereof. A believers ſins make rents and holes in his heart, and through theſe the inward core and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof becomes viſible. Good <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> by his fall comes to know what was in his heart. <hi>Peter</hi> denying his Maſter, comes to underſtand the deſperate deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own heart, which cheated him againſt his own reſolutions, into ſo horrible an iniquity; every actual ſin is to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ſad Commentary on his inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Again, hereby he comes to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63874:108"/>free-grace better then before, that God ſhould melt as man hardens, heal as man falls and bruiſes himſelf afieſh, drop par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons as man doth ſins, return the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as man grieves it away, lengthen out pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience as man abuſes it, uſe lavers as faſt as man runs into pollutions, evidently argues riches of immenſe ſuperabounding grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners. Moreover, hereby he comes to know the neceſſity of a continual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God, conſidering the heats and colds of his heart, the ups and downs of his life, and the interchangeable actings of Hetis and ſpirit, he plainly perceives that he <hi>falls of himſelf and ſtands from God, dies of his own ſpirit, and lives from Gods, ſins of his own, and repents, believes, obeyes, of meer grace,</hi> and ſo underſtands the neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on God; praying continually with the devout Pſalmiſt, <hi>Hold up my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mgs in thy paths, that my footſteps ſlip not. Pſal.</hi> 17.5.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to name no more, <hi>he extracts all out of nothing.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. all things in God, who is all in all. <hi>Zuichemus</hi> gave <hi>Eraſmus</hi> a ring, which, when it was unfolded, repreſented a mundane ſphear, with Aſtrological notes engraven upon it, telling him withall, that now he might wear the whole world on his finger: the conjugal ring, whereby the ſoul is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63874:109"/>to God in Chriſt by faith, hath this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> which, if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, is a ſphear of all things; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever need not ask with <hi>Peter, what ſhall we have? Math.</hi> 19.27. for he hath all in God. It is ſtoried of the <hi>Laudanum</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus,</hi> that it was almoſt good in all caſes; but however that might fail, faith well underſtands that all things may be made out of an intereſt in God the univerſal good; hence it can rationally part with all for him, becauſe it knows, that <hi>there be fathers and mothers, and brothers and ſiſters, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and houſes, and lands, and infinitely more in God.</hi>

                  <p>Of the ſecond holy fruit of Faith in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, its growth upon Faith as a fruit thereof; with the manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, perfection, and various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the ſame.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THUS much for the firſt fruit of faith, being the ſpiritual ſagacities thereof; whereby it appears, that the believer is the only wiſe man, who hath eyes in his head, whileſt all the reſt of the world, be they what they will in notional knowledge, walk on in darkneſs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond holy fruit of faith is <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is a very great bleſſing, ſo great that in <hi>Luthers</hi> phraſe it is <hi>articulus ſtantis &amp; cadentis Eccleſiae;</hi> and in <hi>Chemnitius, arx &amp; propugnaculum religionis Chriſtianae,</hi> a bleſſing that is pregnant with many more; which occaſioned a good Divine to ſay, <hi>ſin committed is every judgment radically, and pardon of ſin is every mercy radically,</hi> you may cut out any bleſſing or comfort out of it; particular mercies are but pardon of ſin ſpecificated and individuated, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that mercy; of all bleſſings you may ſay, this is pardon of ſin, and that is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63874:110"/>pardon of ſin. Touching this precious fruit of faith, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That it grows upon faith as a fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The manner how it grows there.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>Fifthly, The various excellencies of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, This holy fruit grows upon faith;</hi> in the very inſtant of believing a man is juſtified before God. The <hi>Antinomians</hi> indeed makes as if it came forth much ſooner, even as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as eternity it ſelf, as if it were an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent eternal act in God. But the error of this opinion may be eaſily made appear: For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> An immanent act abides in God, and doth not, as the tranſient, make any change at all in the creature; but in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there is a great change made in man, though not a Phyſical one, ſuch as is made in ſanctification, yet as moral and a relative one: the ſins which before cried at heaven gates for vengeance, are now <hi>caſt into the depths of the ſea;</hi> the ſoul, which was at the brink of hell, is now in the ſuburbs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the pure beams of grace breaking forth upon it, the priſon garments of guilt are changed, and <hi>the righteouſneſs of God</hi> is upon the believer, <hi>the blood of the Lamb</hi> is upon his conſcience, and the damning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Law <hi>paſſes over him.</hi> Again, an
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63874:110"/>immanent act in God is the ſame with Gods eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and not as the tranſient, the ſame with the effect produced. Gods willing is but the divine eſſence, with an habitude to ſuch an object; his decrees are himſelf decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, otherwiſe the ſimplicity of his nature would be overthrown: ſuch an immanent act is the decree of juſtification, but juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf is an effect in time, elſe Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial act may be exerciſed about a non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting creature, a <hi>non ens</hi> may be juſtified, a man that is not may be made righteous, fin may be remitted before it is committed, abſolution may anticipate guilt, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs Law, all which are things hard to be ſwallowed. If any thing in juſtification look like an immanent act, it is either Gods complacential love, or the imputation of righteouſneſs; but that neither of theſe are ſuch, is clear in Scripture, which expreſſes the ſame as things future, <hi>he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>righteouſneſs ſhall be imputed to us, if we believe, Rom.</hi> 4.24. a ſhall be cannot be put upon an immanent act, futurity cannot be found in eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If juſtification were an immanent eternal act, what means a Mediator? God and man were at one before; would the Lord of all be made under his own Law, to bring in righteouſneſs into an already righteous world? would he ſhed his precious blood on
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63874:111"/>a croſs to purge away ſins eternally forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? was his ſweet-ſmelling ſacrifice to atone a reconciled God? did he pay down ſo great a ſum of merits to purchaſe a freedom for ſuch as were free-born long before? doth he ſtill intercede with God to ſave thoſe from wrath, who before were ſecure from it by an eternal juſtification? this opinion ſeems to make void the whole ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt; what the Apoſtle ſaid of the Law, <hi>if righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain, Gal.</hi> 2.21. the ſame may be ſaid here, if righteouſneſs come any other way then by the death of Chriſt, if it come by an immanent eternal act, then <hi>Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> No man can be at once in two contrary ſtates, in a ſtate of wrath, and in a ſtate of love too: every man, whileſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, is in a ſtate of wrath, <hi>the wrath of God abides on him, Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>God is angry with him every day, Pſal.</hi> 7.11. and whileſt he is in a ſtate of wrath, he cannot be in a ſtate of love. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whileſt he was in priſon in his old cloaths, was not in change of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a black Catalogue of ſins, barring men from inheriting the kingdom of God, ſaith of the unconverted <hi>Corinthians, ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. as yet they were in the chains of ſin and wrath, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after ſpeaking of them as convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſaith, <hi>but ye are ſanctified, but ye are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63874:111"/>juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God;</hi> then the priſoners were become favourites in the Court of heaven, and ſtood in their robes of grace and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: then and not before, as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears by the words, <hi>were</hi> and <hi>are,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to two diſtinct ſtates in two diſtinct times, they were not, could not be in both ſtates at once, but if juſtification be eternal, a man may be at once in contrary ſtates, as an unbeliever he may be under wrath, and yet as a juſtified one under love. I know a man under wrath may be under a love of benevolence, which is the purpoſe of God to beſtow grace and glory, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the ſame time be under a love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence, which is directly contrary to a ſtate of wrath, nevertheleſs eternal juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation makes a man capable of both at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Juſtification and ſanctification are inſeparable companions, no more to be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred then the merits and ſpirit of Chriſt which are the reſpective cauſes thereof: where grace pardons, there it heals, where Chriſt is <hi>made righteouſneſs,</hi> there he is <hi>made ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> for he cannot be divided and taken by piece-meal, but if juſtification be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act, then theſe twins of grace may be parted, an unconverted man may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, becauſe that is from eternity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unſanctified, becauſe unconverted; in which caſe he muſt needs be in a ſtrange
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63874:112"/>poſture, at once under two contrary reigns of grace and ſin; partly in Chriſt, as juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his blood, and partly out of Chriſt, as void of his ſpirit; the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhines upon him, and yet within he wears the image of Satan, a <hi>bleſſed one</hi> he muſt needs be, becauſe <hi>his iniquity is forgiven,</hi> and <hi>an anathema</hi> too, <hi>becauſe no lover of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he is a juſtified and accepted man, and yet a man in his ſins, all which abſurd conſequences are unavoidable, if juſtification be an eternal act.</p>
               <p>Thus much may ſuffice to diſcover the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of this opinion, only there are two Quaeres which muſt be anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt <hi>Quaere</hi> is this, <hi>If juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not an eternal immanent act, is not there a change in God?</hi> God diſplicentially hates all the workers of iniquity, and ſuch are all men before converſion; if therefore before converſion he hate, and after it he love them, is there not a change in him? I anſwer, no, there is none. God, ſuch is his infinite ſanctity, cannot but complacential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love righteouſneſs, and diſplicentially hate iniquity: love and hatred are not in God, as ſin and righteouſneſs are in man, in man ſin and righteouſneſs ſucceed one the other, but in God love and hatred are eternal and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multaneous; the change therefore, which is where the ſucceſſion is, and not where the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſameneſs is, is in man only, and not in God; the man, who was in a ſtate of ſin,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63874:112"/>and ſo the object of Gods diſplicential ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, is now in a ſtate of righteouſneſs, and ſo the object of Gods complacential love; thus the Apoſtle, <hi>you that were ſometimes ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, Col.</hi> 1.21. All the change was in the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> none in God, <hi>the Lord loveth the righteous,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.8. as ſoon as a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes righteous, the divine complacence doth embrace him, which it did not, could not before, becauſe there was no ſutable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond <hi>Quaere</hi> is this, <hi>If juſtification be not an immanent eternal act, what is the tranſient act by which God juſtifieth a believer in this life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this much is not ſpoken among Divines, ſome ſpeak of a ſentence before the Angels, as if God did declare before them who is righteous; but this I think is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural: others ſpeak of a ſentence in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but this is but the manifeſtation of juſtification. Let us firſt diſtinguiſh of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and then anſwer. There is a double juſtification, <hi>conſtitutive juſtification,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God maketh us juſt in this life; <hi>ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al juſtification,</hi> whereby God pronounces us juſt at death and judgment. Conſtitutive juſtification is the foundation of ſentential, for the true God will not pronounce us juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are ſuch, and ſentential juſtification is the compleature of conſtitutive: For here
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63874:113"/>there is <hi>ſententia judicis</hi> crowning us as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; the <hi>Quaere</hi> then being touching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive juſtification in this life, I conceive with worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter, that God juſtifies a believer by the moral agency of the Goſpel, by which as by his Grand Charter and Law of grace, he doth make over Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to the believer,</hi> neither need this ſeem ſtrange, every humane inſtrument doth, <hi>moraliter agere.</hi> A Princes pardon conveys an impunity, a Charter an eſtate, a Law a title or right, a Teſtament a Legacy, and ſhall not the Goſpel do as much to believers? God doth <hi>conſtitutivè</hi> juſtifie the believer by making him righteous, and makes him righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by making over to him the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, and that he makes over by the Goſpel, which is his Pardon, Charter, Law and Teſtament of grace, conveying the ſame upon believing: no ſooner doth a man believe, but the conditional promiſe becomes abſolute. As the old Covenant running, <hi>do this and live,</hi> would have juſtified upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, ſo the New running, <hi>believe and be ſaved,</hi> doth juſtifie upon believing, as man ſinning is condemned by the Law of works, ſo man believing is juſtified by the Law of grace. Hence the Goſpel is called, <hi>the miniſtration of righteouſneſs</hi> as the Law is <hi>of condemnation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. <hi>the power of God to ſalvation to the believer, Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>quia nos per Evangelium juſtiſicat Deus,</hi> becauſe God juſtifies us by the Goſpel, as Reverend
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63874:113"/>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> hath it on the <hi>17th. verſe, Virga virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, A rod of ſtrength,</hi> Pſal 110.2. that is, in the Juſtification of men, ſaith the excellent Dr. <hi>Reynolds;</hi> and <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus making us free from the law of ſin and death;</hi> as many Divines interpret that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. Upon which <hi>Pareus</hi> doth obſerve, <hi>Liberatio à condemnatione legis, Deo, Chriſto, Evangelio tribuitur, Deo ut Authori, Chriſto ut Mediatori, Evangelio ut Organo: Freedom from the coudemnation of the Law is attributed to God as the Author, to Chriſt as the Mediatour, to the Goſpel as the Inſtrument.</hi> God makes over Chriſt and his righteouſneſs unto the Believer by the Goſpel, as by his Charter and Law of grace. This is the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient act, by which God doth juſtifie us in this life.</p>
               <p>Having thus removed the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Error out of the way, I ſhall reſume my firſt Propoſition, That Juſtification is an holy fruit growing upon Faith; in the very inſtant of believing a man is juſtified; this doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſeveral waies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In Juſtification there muſt be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or foundation; a Righteouſneſs, and a perfect one, ſuch as anſwers the law which man is under. The Law demands of us two things; <hi>perfect Obedience,</hi> due from us as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, and <hi>penal Suffering,</hi> due from us as ſinful Creatures. The firſt Gods holineſs preſſes for in the Command, and the laſt Gods Juſtice calls for in the Threatning.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63874:114"/>The Believer, who hath nothing in himſelf, hath enough in Chriſt to anſwer both. Chriſt fulfilled all the righteouſneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſo ſatisfied Gods Holineſs. Chriſt bore the curſe of the Threatning, and ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Gods Juſtice. Hence <hi>he is the end of the Law to the Believer,</hi> Rom. 10.4. as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Whatever the Law can ask, the total ſum of it is in Chriſt, and from him redounding upon the Believer as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his body. It was a lamentable moan which <hi>Joannes Seneca</hi> made upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;<note place="margin">Mel. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Jure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul. Germano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                  <hi>In vitâ noſtrâ habuimus</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>qui pro nobis chorum frequentarent, qui pro nobis agros colerent, qui pro nobis Miſſas celebrarent &amp; horas canonicas orarent; ſed ubi nunc unum reperiemus, qui pro nobis in Gehennam deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat: In this life we have thoſe that will go to the Quire for us, and plow for us, and ſay Maſs and pray canonically for us; but where is there one that will go to Hell for us?</hi> But the Believer (bleſſed man that he is) need not ſay who will go to Hell for me? Chriſt was made a Curſe for him, neither need he ask, Who will fulfil perfect obedience for me? Chriſt hath done every jot and tittle thereof. The Believer is a man in Chriſt, and ſo ſtands in the pure robes, woven all of Love and Holineſs, by his Saviour; unleſs the Law can find a ſpot or a falſe thread in theſe, he will be, muſt be <hi>recius in Curiâ;</hi> if the Law offer to hale him down to hell, he will do as <hi>Tamar,</hi> when brought forth to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63874:114"/>be burnt, ſhew forth the Bracelets and the Signet, the precious blood and merits of Chriſt, which God cannot but own, as the price of Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In juſtification there muſt be a Juſtifier. It is <hi>God that juſtifieth,</hi> and whom doth he juſtifie but <hi>the Believer in Jeſus?</hi> unto him he makes over Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; unto him he ſeals an actual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and remiſſion; <hi>his ſins are covered,</hi> never to appear more in their ugly hue; blotted out, never to be read more in their bloody chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; <hi>caſt into the depths of the Sea,</hi> and who can fetch them up again? <hi>ſought for and not found,</hi> and who can charge them afreſh upon the Believer? St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the debts of <hi>Oneſimus put upon his account,</hi> Philem. <hi>v.</hi> 18. The Believers ſins do not ſtand, as they did at firſt, upon his ſcore, but upon Chriſts, who came to make an end of them. When the ſwarms of Flies were upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and not upon the Iſraelites, the Text ſaith, <hi>God made a diviſion;</hi> or, as it is in the original, <hi>A redemption between them,</hi> Exod. 8.23. That ſwarms of Guilt ſlie about Unbelievers, and none about Believers, it is becauſe the redemption is between them, on the one hand neglected, and on the other applied: <hi>We are juſtified freely by his grace through the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom 3.24. The Believer is, as I may ſay, a part or portion of Chriſt, wrapped up in his Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63874:115"/>and waſhed in his Blood; an Object all-fair and lovely in the eyes of God, and accepted in the Beloved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Juſtification relates to the Law, which is <hi>norma judicii,</hi> the rule of Judgment. A Believer hath wherewithal to anſwer both Laws; as to the law of Works, he hath Chriſts Righteouſneſs anſwering the demands of it; as to the law of Grace, he hath Faith anſwering the terms of it. <hi>Do this and live</hi> is anſwered by Chriſts Righteouſneſs; <hi>Believe and be ſaved</hi> is anſwered by Faith. <hi>Chriſtus eſt impletio legis, ſpiritus eſt impletio Evangelii.</hi> Chriſt by his pure Obedience fulfilled the Law, the Spirit by working Faith fulfils the Goſpel. If the Believer be charged before God that he is a finner, he can plead the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as a full diſcharge to the Law. If he be charged, that he is an Unbeliever, he can plead his faith as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel. If he be further char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that his very Faith is imperfect, he can again plead the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe imperfections. His imperfect Faith intitles him to the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and that perfect righteouſneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the imperfections of his ſaith. Oh! happy Believer, whom God himſelf may ſearch once and again by either Law, and find nothing of condemnation in him. If the Law come to him, it finds Chriſt the end and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all holineſs there: If the Goſpel come, it finds Faith its own demand and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63874:115"/>condition there; wherefore leſs than righteous he cannot be. Thus much touching the firſt thing, that this holy fruit grows upon Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next thing is the manner how it grows there; <hi>How we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith;</hi> unto which I ſhall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt Negatively, and then Affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Negatively: Faith doth not juſtifie by its own intrinſecal value and and dignity. There is nothing in it commenſurate to ſo great a bleſſing; nothing in it to meaſure with the pure Law; nothing in it to pay off divine Juſtice; nothing in it to weigh againſt the guilt of Sin; nothing in it to purchaſe the favour of God; nothing in it to cover a Soul withal; no, nor the nakedneſs of its own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. It is a poor ſelf-emptying, ſelf-annihilating thing, which lives upon Alms, and goes up and down in the Goſpel from one door of the Promiſes to another to beg a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual livelyhood: all that it hath is in a way of <hi>Receiving.</hi> It receives <hi>the atonement,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>the gift of righteouſneſs,</hi> receives <hi>the ſpirit of Grace,</hi> receives <hi>remiſſion of ſins;</hi> but gives none of them out of its own. Hence it is well obſerved by Divines, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never ſaith, <hi>Faith juſtifieth</hi> in an active ſenſe; but alwaies, <hi>we are juſtified by Faith</hi> in a paſſive ſenſe, becauſe it receives all from Chriſt. This humble Grace, whoſe poſture is to fall down and worſhip before the thrones
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63874:116"/>of Free-grace and of the Lamb: will not turn Free-grace off the throne, nor like <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> ſlay its Maſter Jeſus Chriſt in his merits and imputed righteouſneſs, that it may reign in his room. Again, Faith doth not juſtifie as coming in the room of that perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we owe unto the Law, for God is true, and judgeth according to truth; he doth not, cannot do as the unjuſt Steward, who for an hundred meaſures of oil bid write fifty, but he accounts of things as they are. Faith, which is but a piece of righteouſneſs, and that very imperfect, will not go with him for a compleat univerſal righteouſneſs, but only for what it is; neither will it ſalve the matter to ſay, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> uſe to do, That Faith, though it be not in it ſelf a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is yet reckoned as ſuch <hi>per gratioſam Dei acceptilationem,</hi> by the condeſcending grace of God; for in God, in whom there is perfect Unity, one Attribute doth not interfere with another. Free-grace will not juſtle out truth, by accepting a partial righteouſneſs for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which indeed it is not; neither doth a divine Attribute ever claſh againſt its own deſign. Free-grace will not ſo accept faith, as to fruſtrate its own deſign in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Jeſus Chriſt; which, as appears in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, was, that <hi>Chriſt ſhould be made our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. that <hi>we might be the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. that <hi>his blood may cleanſe us from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. that <hi>his obedience might make many righteous,</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:63874:116"/>Kom. 5.19. but what need all this if Faith be accepted for a compleat righteouſneſs? what room for Chriſts righteouſneſs, as long as Faiths will ſuffice? You will ſay perhaps, that Chriſt by his merits hath purchaſed this of God, that faith ſhould be accepted for a perfect righteouſneſs; but if that be ſo, then Chriſt died not properly for Perſons, but for Graces: Chriſts righteouſneſs was not to cloath poor ſouls in, but to advance faith above it ſelf. Faith is become our immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, material righteouſneſs, and Chriſt only a remote cauſe of it. The Lord Chriſt walks a foot as a meer ſervant to Faith, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Faith rides in his Maſters robes as if it were the very matter of our righteouſneſs; all which is to ſubvert the Goſpel. True Faith will confeſs, as <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>I am not the Chriſt;</hi> I never was crucified for you; I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fulfilled all righteouſnes for you; I am but the Eccho to the Goſpel-grace; I do but prepare a way in the heart for Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, to receive all praiſe and glory there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Affirmatively, And here Divines generally expreſs themſelves thus, <hi>That we are juſtified by faith as an inſtrument receiving Chriſt and his righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus Reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> calls faith,<note place="margin">

Hence we are ſaid in Scripture to be juſtified <hi>by faith</hi> and <hi>through faith,</hi> as it is the means whereby we receive Chriſt and his righteouſneſs. And a late Divine ſpeaks of a double inſtrument in Juſtification; on Gods part the Goſpel is an inſtrument, and on mans, Faith: the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is <hi>manus offerentis,</hi> the hand offering, and Faith <hi>manus accipientis,</hi> the hand receiving Chriſt and his righteouſneſs.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63874:118"/>we believe in Chriſt, not God.</hi> If then Faith, which is properly mans inſtrument, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the inſtrument of Juſtification, a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth no leſs than juſtifie himſelf, which is harſh doctrine to me. Again, When we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith, I ſuppoſe the Scripture doth not intend the tranſient act, but the permanent habit; and if ſo, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how that can be properly, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Inſtrument. <hi>Inſtrumenti cauſalitas eſt in uſu &amp; applicatione;</hi> when it is not in uſe and act, it ceaſes to be an inſtrument. The habit of faith is an habit ſtill, even when its act ceaſes; but when its act ceaſes, what hath it of inſtrumentality.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith, though not properly, may yet in ſome ſenſe be called an Inſtrument,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a peculiar aptitude and recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to accept of the free-gift made in the Goſpel. Hence we are ſaid by it <hi>to receive Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.6. to <hi>receive the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5.11. to <hi>receive the gift of righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 5.17. to <hi>receive forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Acts 26.18. It hath a choice capacity to take in Chriſt with all his benefits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The proper formal reaſon, why we are juſtified by Faith, is, becauſe it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel, on which God, the Great Donor, gives out Chriſt with all his bleſſings.</hi> We are not juſtified by faith, as for any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intrinſecal, or in the nature of it, but as it doth inright and inſtate us into Chriſt and his righteouſneſs; and how is that done?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63874:118"/>the old Law-rule muſt be remembred, <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas donatoris obſervetur:</hi> the Donors Will is the beſt guide; and what is that in this caſe? Clearly in the Goſpel Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are given upon the condition of faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſerting, that it did not pleaſe God to give juſtification upon the condition of faith alone: Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> anſwers him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> Tom. 4. lib. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Vel maximè placuit boc Deo: It pleaſed him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> We muſt take as God gives. God in the great charter gives out Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, upon the condition of faith: Faith therefore inſtates and inrights us into theſe as it is the condition of that grant. And by conſequence we are juſtified by it as ſuch, as when a Prince grants a pardon, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Traitor take it from him with his own hands; his taking it gives impunity, not becauſe of the organical apprehenſiveneſs in the hand, but becauſe it is the <hi>modus dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> the pardon runs upon thoſe terms. So, when God grants juſtification upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of believing, we are juſtified by faith; not becauſe of its intrinſecal receptivity or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiveneſs, but becauſe that faith, which ſtands in the Goſpel as the condition of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is found in the heart.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching the manner, how this holy fruit grows upon Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The next thing conſiderable is the continuance of this holy fruit. Juſtification is a flower of Paradice which never dies; once juſtified, and ever juſtified. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63874:119"/>of God, which is put upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, is never taken off again. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which is ſealed in the Court of heaven, is never reverſed. The cloud of Guiltineſs, once ſcattered, never gathers together. The ſins caſt into the depth of Sea, never come up more.<note place="margin">Camb. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. <hi>p. 384.</hi>
                  </note> When the Jeſuite <hi>Chreicion,</hi> taken at Sea, tore and threw over-board certain papers of dangerous conſequence, the torn pieces were by the wind blown back again into the Ship, and afterwards artificially put together, diſcovered the Popiſh deſign then on foot: but when God caſts our ſins into the depth of the Sea, all the breath of the infernal Spirits can never blow them up again, they ſhall be remembred no more. All things in Juſtification concur to make this good. Free-grace, which is the firſt mover in it, is a fountain ever flowing, and a Sun which knows no going down. The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is the matter of it, is a robe which can never wear out. The Goſpel, which is the Charter of it, is a grant never out of date. Faith, which is the Medium to it, will, under the divine influences ſtirring up the neſt of gracious principles, bud and bloſſom forth in freſh acts, and when the acts ceaſe, it abides in the root, kept alive by the eternal Spirit breathed from the endleſs life of Merit in Chriſt: All which make the righteous man an everlaſting foundation; only here is a <hi>Quaere</hi> to be reſolved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do not Believers fall into ſin? and doth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63874:119"/>not ſin make a breach upon Juſtification? and if ſo, how doth it continue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, The ſins of Believers are either ſins of meer infirmity, and daily incurſion, or ſins of groſs enormity, and conſcience-waſting; ſuch as <hi>Davids</hi> Murther and Adultery, and <hi>Peters</hi> denial of his Maſter: the firſt ſort of theſe through the rich grace of the Goſpel are pardoned, as I may ſo ſay, of courſe, and ſo make no breach at all upon juſtification:<note place="margin">De peccate mortals &amp; veniali.</note> 
                  <hi>Non excludunt fideles à favore Dei, &amp; à ſpe regni coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis: They exclude not Believers from the favour of God, nor from the hope of the heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> ſaith that eminent Divine <hi>Robert Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> God, ſuch is his infinite mercy, doth not impute theſe to them. Hence he bears witneſs of <hi>David, That he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he commanded him all the daies of his life, ſave only in the matter of</hi> Uriah, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5. Infirmities are not reckoned; <hi>the matter of</hi> Uriah is the only exception: The latter ſort of ſins in Believers are groſs enormous ones; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe our famous Divines at the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi> ſay, that theſe are not pardoned to the Believer, till he <hi>per excitatam fidem &amp; poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam veniam impenetraverit: obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by a renewed act of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> His univerſal juſtification is not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and yet, till he renew his faith and repentance, his particular ſin is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; his right to the Kingdom of heaven
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63874:120"/>is not taken away, but only his aptitude. Juſt as the Leper, who whilſt his leproſie was on him had a right to his houſe, but not a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till his purgation. The ſeeds of faith and repentance are in him, but they muſt be ſtirred up into freſh acts.<note place="margin">Wells of Salvation, <hi>pag. 184.</hi>
                  </note> Dr. <hi>Spurſtowe</hi> ſaith, that a Believer under ſuch ſin may not immediately lay hold on the promiſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, until he firſt renew his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; till then to lay hold on the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is not faith but preſumption. Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proceeds according to Gods method, and that is, to give out pardon upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. God firſt hears <hi>Ephraim bemoaning himſelf,</hi> and then <hi>remembers him with mercy, Jer.</hi> 31.18.<note place="margin">Treatiſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> conceives, <hi>That a Believer under ſuch a ſin, without renewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is under an actual guilt obliging him to eternal wrath: neither can he ſay, My God, and My Chriſt.</hi> For mine own part, I conceive that ſuch groſs ſins, being the plain merits of eternal wrath, do ſtab the Believer at the very heart, and leave an helliſh ſting upon the Conſcience. They lie as a dog at the door, ready to tear out his throat, and do, as it were, thruſt off his Soul from Chriſt and Grace. They very much weaken the habits of faith, and other graces, ſo that theſe languiſh and are ready to die. Such diſmal effects as theſe made <hi>David</hi> roar all the day, and cry out of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones; and <hi>Peter</hi> go out and weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, judging and condemning himſelf for

Such ſins make Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in their return to their Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as the Prodigal did, that they are unworthy to be called the Sons of God. Nevertheleſs ſuch groſs ſins of Believers are, as I take it, pardoned as ſoon as committed, even before actual faith and repentance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; I ſay <hi>before actual faith,</hi> for the habit of falth is ſtill in the believer; I ſay, <hi>before repentance renewed afterwards,</hi> for the believer in the very commiſſion of a known ſin hath a kind of repentance; there is ſome <hi>reniſus voluntatis;</hi> the regenerate part op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh. <hi>Cum peccant, eâ tantùm parte quâ non ſunt regeniti peccant, ſecundum verò interiorem partem nolunt, deteſtantur peccatum, ergò non plenâ voluntatate peccant:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. pag. 114.</note> thus Learned <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> My grounds, why ſuch groſs ſins of believers are pardoned before the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts of Faith and Repentance, are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The conceſſions of the above-named worthy Divines induce me to it. They ſay, the Believer, notwithſtanding ſuch ſins, is ſtill in a ſtate of juſtification; and I ſee not, how the guilt of one ſin
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63874:121"/>unpardoned, which obliges him to eternal wrath, can poſſibly conſiſt with a juſtified ſtate. <hi>Juſtificatio nullum locum relinquit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnationi:</hi> They ſay, he hath a right to the kingdom of heaven, and I cannot imagine how an obnoxiouſneſs to wrath reſulting from one unpardoned ſin can <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> ſtand with a right to heaven: They ſay, the holy ſeed of regeneration abides in him ſtill, and I believe regeneration and condemnation cannot be together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scripture-expreſſions are very pregnant: The Believer, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſins, is a believer ſtill; and whilſt ſuch <hi>ſhall not come into condemnation,</hi> Joh. 5.24. He is a man in Chriſt, and to ſuch <hi>there is no condemnation,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Neither do the ſubſequent words hinder, <hi>who walk not after the fleſh;</hi> for thoſe, as I conceive, intend not a ſtep or a partionlar act of ſin, but a walk and general trade of it, ſuch as never is found in a believer; there is <hi>no condemnation</hi> to ſuch. The Apoſtle ſaith not,<note place="margin">Diſp. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol. de per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ.</note> that there is <hi>nihil condemnabile;</hi> but there is, <hi>nulla condemnatio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius.</hi> He ſaith not, there is nothing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the believer, for ſin in it ſelf is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſuch; but there is no condemnation, for the pardon keeps the guilt from redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the perſon; becauſe he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, the believer notwithſtanding ſuch ſins, is a Son ſtill; and <hi>if a ſon, then an heir,</hi> Rom. 8.17. and <hi>if a ſon, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63874:121"/>in the houſe for ever,</hi> Joh. 8.35. He hath ſtill <hi>a Well of water in him ſpringing up to life everlaſting,</hi> Joh. 4.14. And where the ſpirit of Chriſt is ſuch a Well, there the Blood of Chriſt is a laver cleanſing away all ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is conſiderable what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture means, when it ſaith, that <hi>we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith;</hi> doth it mean the act of faith, or the habit? if the act, there ſeem to be as many interciſions in juſtification, as there are ceſſations in the act of faith; upon which account I ſuppoſe that the <hi>vinculum unio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> the bond of Union whereby the Believer is knit unto Chriſt, is not a tranſient thing, ſuch as the act of faith is, but a permanent one, ſuch as the habit; if then the habit be the thing, that abides in the believer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is to me very momentous, that though ſins of infirmity and enormity differ in proportion as much as Gnats and Camels, yet the leaſt of them deſerves condemnation as well as the greateſt, and the greateſt of them may have pardon in the very ſame way as the leaſt. There are not in the Goſpel two diſtinct waies appointed for pardon; one way for the pardon of infirmities, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way for the pardon of groſs ſins: but there is one undivided way of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance appointed for both. Which being ſo, it follows, that if the believers groſs ſins be not forgiven till after actual faith and repentance, then neither are his infirmities
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63874:122"/>forgiven till then; and by conſequence the believer cannot continue juſtified no not for a minute; the multitudes of infirmities, which are ever ſwarming in him, would put him into a ſtate of death every moment. Nay, as worthy Mr. <hi>Wall</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>in ictu mortis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None but Chriſt, <hi>pag. 322.</hi>
                  </note> in the very laſt ſtroak of death he may periſh, unleſs the laſt operation of his ſpirit be actual faith and repentance. Theſe things perſwade me, that the groſs ſins of believers are at leaſt in ſome ſenſe pardoned before their freſh acts of faith, and repentance; touching which Divines ſpeak variouſly. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Believers as ſoon as they ſin have an imperfect pardon, though not plenary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lect. <hi>113.</hi> on the <hi>51.</hi> Pſalm.</note> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> ſaith, <hi>They have a pardon upon record in heaven; but not the comfort of it, till by faith and repentance they ſue it out, and be able to ſhew and plead it in the Court of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſaith, <hi>When any Soul is taken into Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Expoſ en Hoſ. <hi>p. 611.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>it hath not only all the ſins it hath committed pardoned, but there is a pardon laid in for all ſins to come: there is no inſtant of time wherein it can be ſaid, that the Believer is under condemnation.</hi> What is the apteſt expreſſion, I ſhall not contend, but I conceive ſuch ſins in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are in ſome ſort pardoned before their freſh acts of faith and repentance. Neither doth this open a gap to licentiouſneſs, for it concerns only Believers, whom the ſtings of Conſcience, celipſes of Gods face, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guors
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63874:122"/>of inward graces, and foul blots upon their Evidences to heaven, will under the influences of the Spirit preſs to freſh acts of ſaith and repentance, as to duties very neceſſary and incumbent upon them.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the continuance of this holy fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth thing conſiderable is <hi>the perfection of it:</hi> This holy fruit is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully ripe till the day of Judgment. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3.19. The day of Judgment is to a believer a time of refreſhing: then there will be no more ſcorches from the fiery Law, no more ſtings from the old Serpent, no more guilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming the Conſcience, no more frowns from the holy God; but a pure, ſweet refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion breathed out from his gracious preſence. <hi>Caſpar Olevian,</hi> in his laſt ſickneſs,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The top-ſtone of Juſtification ſhall be then laid on to make it compleat, as may appear by the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here the Believer is juſtified pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately by the Goſpel, but then he ſhall be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63874:123"/>juſtified openly by the ſolemn ſentence of God before all the World; here he hath the white-ſtone of Abſolution given in ſecret, but then it ſhall be brought forth to view, glittering in all the orient colours of Free-grace. It was a great honour done to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> to be arraied in Royal apparel, and to have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed before him, <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour.</hi> But oh! what glory will be upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever at that day; when he ſhall ſtand in the glorious rightcouſneſs of Chriſt, and hear it proclaimed before Men and Angels, <hi>This is a righteous man, when Chriſt ſhall confeſs him before his Father and the holy Angels, to be a piece of himſelf, of his fleſh and of his bones?</hi> As it was with the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> paſſing before <hi>Samuel; Eliab</hi> came and was refuſed, <hi>Abinadab</hi> came and was reſuſed; and ſo others; at laſt <hi>David</hi> came, and the Lord ſaid, <hi>Ariſe, anoint him, for this is he,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam. 16th.</hi> Chapter: So it will be with the Sons of men, at the great day of Judgment. The great Potentate may come and be rejected as a vile perſon; the rich Dives may come and be put away as droſs; the Learned Rabbi may come, and be turned off as a fool, only when the Believer comes, God will ſay, <hi>This is he;</hi> this muſt reign in glory for ever. This is a Juſtification before God after a moſt ſignal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:63874:123"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here the Believer ſtands juſtified, but in the midſt of briers and thorns; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Corruptions vex and tear his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſoul from day to day. He is in the Land of Promiſe, but the <hi>Canaanite</hi> is not quite driven out; the reliques of Sin inmates in the ſame heart with grace, like the Liers in wait for <hi>Samſon,</hi> are ready to make an aſſault upon him. Hence the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors ſay, <hi>That God calls no man Saint, or Holy, till he be dead and in the grave; becauſe,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the concupiſcential frame is not quite out of him before death,</hi> but at that day there ſhall be <hi>nihil damnabile</hi> remaining in him. Sin ſhall be no more: no more tumors of Pride; no more boilings up of Concupiſcence; no more ſpots or wrinckles, or dark ſhades of Infirmity; nothing but pure, ſpotleſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Inſomuch that Divines ſay, that from henceforth our Juſtification ſhall be in another way than by imputed Righteouſneſs; becauſe having perfect inherent Righteouſneſs in our ſelves we ſhall need no covering. If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay of a Believer, that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here the Believer is Juſtified, but the duſt of mortality hangs about him. It may be there is a Stone ready to drop into the Bladder, or an Impoſthume ready to break in the Head; <hi>Mors latet in mediis abdita viſeeribus,</hi> in one part of the body or other
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63874:124"/>Death is preparing his arrow upon the ſtring, to ſhoot man down from the perch of this life into the grave. But at that day there ſhall be <hi>nihil corruptibile;</hi> Death ſhall be no more; Diſeaſes, which uſe to ſound an alarum to it, ſhall be utterly removed; Tears, which are Natures pay to Sorrows, ſhall be all wiped off; the corruptible ſhall put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; Mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of Life. This is <hi>a day of redemption</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here the Believer is Juſtified, but his comfort is not alwaies the ſame. Now the light of Gods Countenance breaks out like a clear Sun upon him, and anon there is a ſad eclipſe leaving him in darkneſs; one day a banquet of heavenly Comforts is let down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, and another all is drawn up into heaven again. His Evidences may be blurred; Satan may hold up his pardoned Sins, as it were, in their old guilt; the Arrows of God may ſtick faſt in him, and bring qualms and ſick-fits upon his Conſcience: But at that day his Comforts ſhall be unvariable; a nightleſs Day, and a cloudleſs Horizon; an eternal feaſt upon God and all things in him; his Evidences all clear; and, after but this once ſhewing forth, an everlaſting poſſeſſion of the expected Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The Accuſer, Satan, ſhall be ſtruck dumb at the bleſſed ſentence of pardon and acceptance pronounced by God before Men and Angels. God ſhall never frown or wound him any more, but wrap him up in the arms
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63874:124"/>of endleſs love and joy. This will be <hi>a day of refreſhing</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the perfection of this holy fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The laſt thing is <hi>the excellency of it.</hi> God himſelf writes upon the Juſtified, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Bleſſed one: Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered, Pal.</hi> 32.1. or, as the original, <hi>Bleſſedneſſes is he:</hi> there is not one ſingle Happineſs, but a cluſter of Beatitudes in this eſtate. Some of theſe I ſhall gather off from this Vine.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Juſtified perſon hath God for his God:</hi> theſe two, I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and, I will be their God; ſtand in conjunction in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.10, and 12 <hi>verſes. God</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins) <hi>hath the key of the Womb, the key of the Grave, the key of the Rain, and the key of the Heart;</hi> all that is in the Creation is at his diſpoſe. The Juſtified man hath, as I may ſay, a key into God himſelf. He may unlock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Treaſures, and ſay, Theſe everlaſting Arms, which bear up the World, are mine for protection: Theſe All-ſeeing Eyes, which guide every wheel in Nature, are mine for direction: Thoſe immenſe Bowels, which cover all the Creation, embrace and ſold me up in ſpecial Love: Thoſe two all-compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing words, <hi>My God,</hi> are in truth utterable by none but ſuch as he is. God is called, <hi>the God of Abraham, Iſaack, and Jacob. Cujus omnes gentes ſunt, quaſi trium hominum Deus eſset,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:63874:125"/>ſaith St. <hi>Auſtine:</hi> as if the Great Lord of all things were appropriated to thoſe three Men. Such honour have all Juſtified ones: God is their own, and to make this ſure, they have bonds and bills under Gods own hand; they can in one Promiſe ſhew a title to his Power, and in another to his Mercy, and in a third to his Wiſdom; and in that, <hi>I will be their God.</hi> They can lay a juſt claim to all that is in him, which, what it amounts unto, is more than the tongue of Men and Angels can expreſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Juſtified perſon hath Chriſt for his own.</hi> When the covetous King of <hi>Egypt</hi> built an houſe for his great Treaſures, the cunning Architect left a looſe Stone in the building, that ſo he might have free acceſs thereinto. What entrance he had by craft into the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Treaſures, that Juſtified perſons have by a fair grant into all the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, Merit, Spirit, Life, Death, Righteouſneſs, Redemption, Fulneſs, Glory, all that is in Chriſt is their own. If his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs can ſtand before God, ſo will they. If his Blood can waſh away ſin, they ſhall be without ſpot or wrinckle at the Great day: If his glorious over-meaſure of the Spirit cannot fail, no more will their ſupplies of Grace: If he aſcended up into Heaven, it was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for them: If he make Interceſſion above, they muſt have acceſs to the Throne of Grace: If he ſit at the Right-hand of Power and Majeſty, all their enemies muſt be made their foot-ſtool. Oh! infinite enjoyment; <hi>Eye hath not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63874:125"/>ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither can it enter into mans heart,</hi> what the total ſum of this is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Juſtified man hath a rare pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in his Holy duties.</hi> He hath aſſiſtance from, acceſs unto, and acceptance with the great God in theſe. He hath aſſiſtance from him. Whileſt he ſtands offering up holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, fire comes down from heaven upon the Sacrifice. The Holy Spirit inflames his heart towards God; opening it in Hearing, melting it in Alms, and pouring it out in Prayer: So that in ſome ſence he offers up his Duties, as Chriſt did himſelf, <hi>through the eternal Spirit,</hi> enlivening and impowering him thereunto. His voyage to Heaven lies through a tract of various Duties; but it never fares with him in theſe, as it did with Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby,</hi> in his Voyage to <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> in which he was by extream Froſts frozen to death. The warm influences of Grace keep him from freezing in this divine enterprize. His heart, which ſeeks the Lord in his waies, ſhall live; and to make it ſure, our Saviour ſaies expreſly, <hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.19. <hi>His life is hid with Chriſt.</hi> As long as Chriſt the Head is alive above, the Members below ſhall never fail of quickening grace in their addreſſes to God. Again, he hath acceſs unto God in them: A man under guilt cannot approach unto God, no more than fallen <hi>Origen,</hi> caſting his eye upon that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, What but thou to do to declare my
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63874:126"/>Word?</hi> could tell how to Preach; but the Juſtified man may draw near unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>heart is ſprinckled from an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> The guilt, which would have made him ſhie of God, is done away in Chriſts blood. Whilſt others are but in the outward Court, in the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> the work done, he may enter into the Holy of Holies, into communion with God; the Holy Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts him thither through the vail of Chriſts fleſh. Moreover, which is the crown of all, he hath acceptance with God. <hi>God had reſpect to</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his offering, Gen.</hi> 4.4. ſuch a reſpect as to bear witneſs to his righteouſneſs by ſome viſible ſign, as fire from heaven conſuming the Sacrifice. The juſtified man is in his meaſure as <hi>Daniel, a man of Deſires,</hi> and as the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or highly favoured.</hi> His Prayers make me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in heaven; his Alms are the ſavour of a ſweet-ſmell; he doth not loſe ſo much as a cup of cold water, nor ſhut a door of ſenſe againſt an approaching Temptation in vain. There is a well-pleaſingneſs in all his Services, as being uſhered forth from the heart into the hand of the Mediatour, and there richly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funed for the Father; though, as they lie in our hearts, there be much ſmoak and mixture of weakneſs in them, yet as they are in the hand of Chriſt, they are glorified duties, <hi>acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:63874:126"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Juſtified man hath more of the ſweetneſs of life, and its outward Comforts, than others.</hi> He hath more of the ſweetneſs of life than others. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctours treating about the eſtimation of Perſons, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. ſay, That if a man be adjudged to death for his tranſgreſſion, he is not to be valued, becauſe he is but a dead man, and there is no valuation of the dead. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned man is dead while he liveth, and as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>condemned already,</hi> Joh. 3.18. His life, ſave only as it is a ſpace for repentance, and ſo for pardon, muſt be rated at little or nothing. <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, valued not his life at all, when he was carried up and down in an Iron-cage: and what is a mans life, when he walks up and down in chains of ſin and wrath? but as ſoon as the pardon comes, he <hi>lives indeed.</hi> His life, as little a vapour as it is in it ſelf, glitters as a Jewel in the Sun, being irradiated with that precious favour of God, which is better than it ſelf: Moreover, he hath more of the ſweetneſs of outward Comforts than others. The unpardoned man may have Corn, and Wine, and all other Bleſſings flowing round about him; but if his eyes be open, he can take no more pleaſure in them than <hi>Damocles</hi> did at the Tyrants table, ſpread with all Royal dainties, whileſt the Sword with the point downward, hung over his head by an hair only: If he taſts ſweetneſs in them,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63874:127"/>it is an act of meer blindneſs and irrationality; becauſe he ſeeth not the arrow of Gods wrath, which is upon the ſtring, and ready in a moment to ſhoot him down to the loweſt hell. Do but open his eyes upon the <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Guilt,</hi> which is on <hi>the wall of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and all his crackling Joyes are in a moment turned into fits of trembling and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment; but as ſoon as the Pardon comes every thing reliſhes with him. <hi>Moſes,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a bleſſing on <hi>Joſeph</hi> thus, <hi>Bleſſed of the Lord be his Land; for the precious things of beaven, for the dew, and for the deep that cometh beneath, and for the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by the Moon, and for the chief things of the ancient Mountains, and for the precious things of the laſting Hills, and for the precious things of the Earth, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> adds this as the crown of all, <hi>and for the good-will of him that dwelt in the Buſh, Deut.</hi> 33.13, 14, 15, and 16 <hi>verſes.</hi> The favour of God pours a ſweetneſs into all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: Then may he eat, and drink, and enjoy all his labours; for the light of Gods Providence, and the light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance are met in conjunction.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Juſtified man hath leſs evil in Aſſlictions than others.</hi> The unjuſtified man carries a double load; one of aſſliction, and another of unpardoned guilt, which lies as a talent of lead on the Conſcience, and makes
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63874:127"/>the Croſs lie heavy as a burthen on a ſore-back: But the Juſtified man hath only the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Croſs, which the ſpirit of a man may bear. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> could ſhoulder-up their reaſon againſt it; <hi>Nos dicimus omnia iſta, quae gemitus mugituſque exprimunt, levia eſſe: We ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>all theſe things, which extort cries and groans, are but light,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca.</hi> And what then may the Believer ſay, who hath a ſerene Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, made ſo by the pure beams of Divine favour? <hi>Feri, Domine, feri clementer; ego paratus ſum, quia à peecatis abſolutus: Strike, Lord, ſtrike; I am ready, becauſe I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from my ſins,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luther;</hi> when he was in fear of an Apoplexy. The pardon of ſin wonderfully alleviated the Croſs. Again, the unjuſtified man is a poor helpleſs Creature: Trouble comes, and there is no deliverer; he falls alone, and there is not a reconciled God to help him up; <hi>God walks contrary to him:</hi> or, as the original may be read, <hi>He walks at all adventures with him,</hi> Levit. 26.24. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he will deliver him, peradventure not: But the Juſtified man, being in Chriſt the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> is ſure to have God with him; God with him in the fire, and God with him in the water; whatever the Croſs be, the Almighty Father puts under the everlaſting arms; the Eternal Son walks with him in the midſt of the Furnace; the Holy Spirit drops in heavenly cordials upon his heart; as it was with Chriſt, when he hung upon the Croſs,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63874:128"/>and drunk up the bittereſt cup of wrath. The Divinity never left the Humanity, no not when he cried out of <hi>forſaking:</hi> So is it with the Believer, the man in Chriſt; when Troubles come like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſengers, one upon the neck of another, <hi>God never leaves nor forſakes him,</hi> which is a cordial high enough to make any adverſity more eligible than all proſperity. Hence ſome good men have been loath to leave their Priſons, for fear of parting with thoſe inward joyes, which had turned them into a paradice.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Juſtified man knows how to die, and go to judgment.</hi> He knows how to die, which is a leſſon too hard for any other but ſuch as himſelf. The <hi>Stoick</hi> may ſeem to vapour over death, as a thing of nothing; but whileſt he doth ſo, it is but a piece of blind raſhneſs, never conſidering the vaſt gulph of Eternity which is then to be ſhot, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, where that Gulph is better known. Many great Rabbies and Sophies are nonpluſt at the approach of death. The great <hi>Cardinal Richelieu,</hi> a little before his end would have a play, called <hi>Europe triumphante</hi> to be acted, though he was not able to be a ſpectator; it ſeems his Soul, hanging about the mud walls, as loth to go off that ſtage where he had acted ſo many wiſe parts, knew not how to apply it ſelf to that grand affair of death approaching. Only the juſtified man knows how to reſign, and beſpeak his parting
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63874:128"/>Soul as <hi>Monica</hi> did, <hi>Volemus in coelum: Let us flie to heaven;</hi> or with <hi>Hilarion, Egredere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mea, egredere, quid times? quid dubitas? Go out my Soul, go out; what doeſt thou ſear or doubt?</hi> And all this upon ſure grounds. His ſin is pardoned; his death unſtung; heaven-gates ſtand open for him; a convoy of Angels are ready to conduct his Soul into <hi>Abrahams boſom.</hi> So little tremendous is death to ſuch an one, that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> being mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cried out, <hi>Ecquid hoc infortunii? Is this any misfortune?</hi> the Body only was ſlain, the Soul was untouched, and but a little the ſooner let out into glory. Again, The juſtified man knows how to go to Judgment. When the Earl <hi>Montgomery</hi> was brought before the great Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ingeniouſly confeſſed, That, as many great Armies as he had ſeen without fear, yet he could not but tremble at the preſence of thoſe grave Judges. At the Great day, when the laſt Trump ſhall ſound, and the dead riſe out of the duſt, and Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come with all his glorious Angels to judge the World, there will be generally nothing but pale faces, and trembling hearts, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out-cries to the Rocks and Mountains, to fall upon them, and cover them from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Judge: Only the Juſtified man may lift up his head with joy, becauſe <hi>his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draws nigh.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the Judge is his Head and Advocate, and will not, cannot condemn the Believer, being a piece of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63874:129"/>ſtanding in his image and righteouſneſs. Sin and Satan have nothing at all to ſay againſt him. The Law cannot object the breach of the leaſt jot or tittle; he comes to the Judgment, only to be abſolved before Men and Angels, and after an <hi>Enge</hi> of praiſe, to <hi>enter into the joy of his Lord;</hi> which is an happineſs beyond all expreſſion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The next fruit thereof is <hi>Adoption:</hi> Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Adoption are twin-Graces, brought forth by Faith at once; only in order of nature,</p>
               <p>Juſtification goes firſt, and then follows Adoption, as preſuppoſing the other; hence <hi>the new name is ſaid to be written in the white ſtone, Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of the World, was by the flattering Oracle ſaluted as a <hi>Son of Jupiter;</hi> but the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who overcomes the World in a more noble Spiritual way, is by the true Oracle ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Son of God; As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, Joh.</hi> 1.12. The Believer in the inſtant of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is no longer a meer Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but a Son of God; he is in unity with the natural Son of God, and ſo becomes an Adopted one. The Human nature is in the natural Son by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical union, and ſo is taken into the natural Sonſhip; and the Believer is in him by a Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union, and ſo becomes a Son by Adoption: Neither is this a meer empty title, <hi>He is born not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63874:130"/>of blood,</hi> in a way of carnal Generation, <hi>not of the will of the fleſh,</hi> in a way of Concupiſcence; <hi>not of the will of man,</hi> in the way of Moral Virtues and Excellencies; but <hi>he is born of God,</hi> he is one of the ſeed-Royal of Heaven, the blood of God runs in his Conſcience, a Divine Spirit breaths in him; <hi>Chriſt is formed in his heart,</hi> and that in the very ſame manner as he was in the Womb; that is, <hi>by the overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nay further, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Tertia pars Queſt. 23.

                  </gap>, or <hi>brightneſs of his Father;</hi> and in the Adopted there is a ſplendor of Grace reſembling God in a meaſure: The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son was begotten from Eternity, and is ſtill a begetting; and in the Adopted the holy thing is begotten: And yet in reſpect of the ſucceſſive ſupplies of Grace afforded for its preſervation, it is as it were ſtill a begetting; hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Son, as well as the Natural, <hi>abides for ever,</hi> Joh. 8.35. The Natural Son is the image of Gods Nature, and the Adopted the image of his Will; <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1.18.</p>
               <p>The Excellencies of this Priviledg are unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable: I ſhall expreſs them only in ſome Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Adoption is a very glorious thing;</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the glory of Free-grace, and puts a luſtre upon the Believer; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the glory of Free-grace: <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:63874:130"/>upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. That the indefectible God, who hath a Son of his own lying in his boſom as an eternal joy, ſhould Adopt; that the great Creator, who as ſuch hath all poſſible right to his Creature, ſhould Adopt; that the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal One, to whom by reaſon of his Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there can be no ſucceſſion, ſhould yet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt; that ſuch a Majeſty as he is ſhould A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt ſuch as we are, worms and ſinful duſt, and Adopt us to ſuch an Inheritance as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is; and by putting a new nature into us, make us meet for the ſame, is ſtupendious and wonderful beyond expreſſion. Such Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as theſe made the great School-man <hi>Durandus</hi> (as <hi>Medina</hi> relates) affirm, <hi>That God did not Adopt properly,</hi> but <hi>Secundum Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> in a <hi>Metaphorical way.</hi> But to paſs that, theſe things ſignally demonſtrate, that Divine Adoption is full of rich Grace, and in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent manner above Humane. Moreover, Adoption puts a luſtre upon the Believer, ſuch as is not to be found upon the Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the Earth.<note place="margin">Par. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla hiſt.</note> The proud <hi>Sultan Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> uſed in his Letters to arrogate theſe high Titles to himſelf; <hi>I Achmet head of Prophets, Emperour of Emperours, Lord of Europe, Aſia, and Africa, Lord of the White, Black, and Red Seas,</hi> ſubjoining a long Enumeration of all the Provinces under him: But to be a Son of God is incomparably more than all theſe. All that train of Titles whereby Potentates ſpread out their Glory, is <hi>fumus ſeculi,</hi> the ſmoke of this lower World, and glitters only in the eyes of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63874:131"/>fleſh and blood; but Adoption is <hi>radius Caeli,</hi> a ray of Heavenly Glory, and makes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſhine to the eyes of Angels; who, as they rejoice over a repenting Sinner, cannot but wonder to ſee ſuch an one transfigured into a Son of God: Nay, Adoption puts ſuch a glory upon the Believer as was not upon <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. <hi>Adam</hi> was a Son of God only by Creation, but the Believer is one by Myſtical Union and Communion with Chriſt the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son; hence Chriſt calls him <hi>Brother,</hi> Heb. 2.11. a Compellation not uſed to Angels; and he is one of the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> Heb. 12.23. a title in an eminent way given to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adoption carries with it an excellent ſpirit of Prayer; Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba father,</hi> Gal. 4.6. This praying Spirit is the breath of the New-creature, and as much excels all meer modes and gifts of Prayer, as a pair of natural Lungs doth artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ones; others may pray artificially, and as it were mechanically, but the Adopted man prays naturally; without this Spirit all words and expreſſions in Prayer are but poor low things; like the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſecond Temple, by which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not tell how to ask counſel of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the holy Spirit was not preſent with it: In the Adopted that Spirit makes the Prayer iſſue forth with life and power; when the Blood and Merits of Chriſt plead above, and the holy Spirit makes interceſſion in the heart for the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63874:131"/>ſame bleſſings, there is ſuch a Harmony, that the Almighty ſloops and bows down his car to it. Thus the ſweet Singer, <hi>In waiting I waited for the Lord, and he enclined unto me, and beard my cry,</hi> Pſal. 40.1. God himſelf enclines and ſtoops down at the Prayer of Faith. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula Pater,</hi> that little word, Father, ſpoken in the heart is more than all the Eloquence of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Com. in Gal. cap. 4.</note> ſaith <hi>Luther:</hi> No ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth the Child of Grace cry, but God ſays, <hi>Here am I,</hi> Iſa. 58.9. as if he were always at hand to anſwer the requeſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Adoption uſhers in an Heavenly free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> whileſt the Law is only without in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the terrors of <hi>Sinai</hi> flaſh in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the man with his old heart of enmity, drudges in the ways of God, and brings forth all his Duties as the Bond-woman did her Son, in the power of nature, in a dead, carnal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile manner: <hi>Moſes</hi> with the cords of Hell and Death drags the outward man to this and that Duty; but old <hi>Adam</hi> with his luſts, reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning within, holds back the love and the joy, and the delight from the work: all <hi>renders to bondage,</hi> till Adoption come, and ſpirit him for holy things: <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, Gal.</hi> 4.6. The ſame Spirit which led the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſt into all Sinleſs Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, leads the Adopted into a true willingneſs to all the Ways of God, that Spirit engraves a Law within anſwering the outward one, and inſpires ſuch a Divine Love, as <hi>caſts out the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63874:132"/>Bond woman and her Son,</hi> I mean the ſervile fears, and ſervices; the Will is ſet upon the wheels of Faith and Love, and the Duties are brought forth in the power of Grace, and of the Promiſe; that Promiſe, <hi>I will put my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> Ezek. 36.27. is ſweetly experimented in every act of Obedience; this glorious and almoſt Angelical freedom grows upon Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no where elſe; no will of man ever ſeemed out ſuch a thing; ſhould any man go about to ſtrike it out of his own power, it would fare with him as it did with the perſon reported of by one of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbies, who in the night lighted his Candle, and it went out, lighted it again and again, and ſtill it went out; at laſt weary of ſuch vain labours, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with himſelf to wait for the Sun. Such an one may ſtrike and ſtrike again to fetch ſuch a liberty out of his own will; but at laſt the Concluſion muſt be, <hi>If the Son make us free, we ſhall be free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8.36. and, <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Adoption brings us into ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God;</hi> thus the Apoſtle. <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them,</hi> who can expreſs it? In the Sons of God there is an Ark with the Tables of the Law in it, and a Sanctuary with the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſtly</hi> in it; Gods gracious preſence is Spiritual ſhew-bread,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63874:132"/>and his Love burns upon the heart, as the fire that came down from Heaven upon the Altar; when they are ſacrificing in holy Duties, <hi>God doth wonderfully</hi> by his quickening, and elevating influences; and when they are ſuffering in the briers and flames of affliction, <hi>God is in the Buſh</hi> ſupporting and preſerving them; if Conſcience breaths ſweetneſs and peace, <hi>God is in the ſtill voice;</hi> if their Graces be ſet forth, <hi>God is a ſupping with them;</hi> nay, if there be but a poor ſpirit and weak deſires, God will ſup with theſe; the holy light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in their heart is a kind of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> to direct them, and the Heavenly motions and inſpirations are as it were a <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> a voice from Heaven for their inſtruction; in a word, all the appearances of God in the worldly Sanctuary, and outward Symbols of Glory under the Old Teſtament, are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompliſhed under the New in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, who are <hi>an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Adoption aſſures protection and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Iſrael, Gods own People, had a Pillar of Cloud, and a Pillar of Fire to defend them, and theſe Pillars are ſtill in the Church, though not always viſible: God hath ſaid it, <hi>That he will create upon her a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night, upon all the glory ſhall be a defence,</hi> Iſa. 4.5. Rather than his Adopted ones, who carry his Glory about them, ſhall want a defence he will put forth an act of Creation: <hi>Iſrael</hi> when in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63874:133"/>had Bread from Heaven, and Water out of the Rock; and to the upright, God ſaith, <hi>Their Bread ſhall be given them, and their Waters ſhall be ſure,</hi> Iſa. 33.16. Rather than fail, <hi>He will make rivers in the deſert, to give drink to his People,</hi> Iſa. 43.20. When there's a pinch in the Kingdom of Nature, his own Family and Houſhold ſhall be provided for; <hi>The young Linons may lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Pſal. 34.10. That Diſtich,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Eſt Deus in coelo, qui providus omnia curat,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Credentes nuſquam deſeruiſſe poteſt;</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Was a Cordial to <hi>Muſculus</hi> in his ſtreights. Faith fears no Famine, neither ſhall the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted feel any.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Adoption carries with it Perſeverance;</hi> Once a Son of God by Adoption and ever ſo. One of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors Commenting on that excellent paſſage, <hi>With thee is the fountain of life, in thy light ſhall we ſee light,</hi> Pſal. 36. ſaith, <hi>That the Iſraelites were made free by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>and then brought into bondage again, and made free by</hi> Barak <hi>and divers others, and yet brought into bondage again; at laſt they ſhall be ſaved by the Lord their God with an eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that is,</hi> by the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> If meer noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make us free, we ſhall be in bondage again; if Church-priviledges make us free, we ſhall be in bondage again; but if Adopting Grace make us free, we ſhall ever be ſo: God hath ſaid, nay, ſworn to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>His ſeed</hi> (and ſuch are all the Adopted) <hi>ſhall endure for ever,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63874:133"/>and his throne</hi> (part whereof is in their hearts) <hi>as the Sun before me,</hi> Pſal. 89.36. and to make them endure, the holy Spirit is in them a <hi>well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. and to ſecure the abode of the Spirit with them, <hi>Chriſt is a Prieſt after the power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life,</hi> Heb. 7.16. Nay, though they break his ſtatutes, and thereby bring the rod upon their backs, yet God hath promiſed, <hi>Not to take away his loving kindneſs, nor ſuffer his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fail,</hi> Pſal. 89.33. Upon ſuch unſhaken foundations do the Sons of God ſtand.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Adoption makes them heirs of Heaven;</hi> Though they may lye among the pots, and in the eyes of the World be the refuſe and off-ſcouring of all things, yet are they heirs of Glory; thus the Apoſtle, <hi>If children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. That Glory which Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhall they be brought into; that Heavenly Inheritance, which is ſealed without in the Promiſe, is inwardly aſſured to them by the Seal of the Spirit; which by holy impreſſes marks them out for Heaven, and is a ſure ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in their hearts, that the whole ſum of glory ſhall be paid to them above: each of them may ſay as <hi>Quirinus Reuterus</hi> did on his Death-bed, <hi>Ego ſum vitae filius, I am a child of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the third fruit of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adoption.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of <hi>Sanctification</hi> the fourth fruit of Faith, and here of <hi>Mortification</hi> the firſt part thereof; the influence of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith therein.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next fruit of Faith is <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which makes the Soul meet for Heaven; Juſtification and Adoption give a title to that bleſſed Inheritance, but Sanctification makes ready for it. No ſooner doth a man believe, but the rivers of living water, the ſanctifying Spirit with its Graces ſlow in the heart; and the reaſon is evident, Faith is the Souls Union with Chriſt, who hath the Spirit above meaſure in truſt, to pour it out upon every part of his Myſtical Body; in this day of Eſpouſals the water is turned into wine, Nature elevated into Grace. There are, as I have before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, two parts of Sanctification, <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Vivification.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to both as fruits of Faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Mortification</hi> is a fruit of Faith, indeed none but a Believer is in a poſture to reach it. Could a man which yet never falls out, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Reaſon and Will to the utmoſt, he could not truly mortifie Sin: Reaſon and Will improved might in ſome meaſure triumph over the groſs inordinations in the lower fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but they would ever ſpare the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63874:134"/>in themſelves as their own fleſh; like politick Princes, who keep down mutinies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common People, but lay the reins down to their own perſonal vices: It would fare with ſuch an one, as it doth with frozen waters, which though broken in one place, will freez in another; ſhould he break and diſſolve his ſenſual Sins, he would freez in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; and if his eyes were open, he would ſee that it is deſperate pride and preſumption to attempt Mortification in any other way than that of Faith, which brings a general thaw upon the heart, melting it into a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Divine Pleaſure, and tracing the method of the Goſpel, derives a power and ſpirit from Chriſt for the work. Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be done <hi>through the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.13. and none hath that but the Believer; it ſlows from an implantation into the death of Chriſt, and none is ſo but he; <hi>Faith purifies the heart,</hi> and without it there can be no ſuch thing as Mortification. God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Mortification immediately, but in its own place, firſt Faith, and then Mortification; <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherefore? <hi>Becauſe you are riſen with Chriſt;</hi> becauſe <hi>your life is hid with Chriſt;</hi> therefore mortifie; None but Believers, who are in Union with Chriſt, are capable to do it. When in Popery all ſorts are driven to this work, as the poor <hi>Indians</hi> are to Baptiſm; they do but ſet up a Faithleſs, Chriſtleſs Image of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63874:135"/>Mortification in Penances and Satisfactions, void of the true ſpirit and principle requiſite thereunto.</p>
               <p>In the purſuit of this Point I ſhall firſt ſpeak to the Mortification of <hi>Original Sin;</hi> this is to lay the axe to the root, and caſt ſalt into the fountain; without which to go about to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie this or that particular luſt, is as great a vanity, as for a man by outward applications to heal up a fore or ulcer in the body, without correcting the inward <hi>ſomes</hi> of peccant and corrupt humours, which bore thoſe holes in the fleſh and fill them with putrefaction. This is one choice work of Faith. Others may ſpend all upon Phyſicians and Humane reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but the Believer gives ſuch a touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Crucified Chriſt, as in a good meaſure to ſtanch the bloody iſſue running down his nature. In this excellent work Faith proceeds on this wiſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith gives a man a juſt ſenſe of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin;</hi> Which, if the World be ſearched with Candles, can be found no-where but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Believers: To ſearch for it in the Pagan World, is to no purpoſe; indeed <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Soul hath broken her wings, and creeps baſely upon theſe lower things.</hi> The <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi> taught, <hi>That Souls having offended God, were turned into Bodies as into ſo many Priſons, there to look out of the grates of Senſe. Triſmegiſtus</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That man fell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Contemplations into the ſphear of Elements, and ſo became a bondſlave to his Body. Hierocles</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:63874:135"/>confeſſes, <hi>That man is carried downward, and fallen from the happy Region, of his own motion inclined to evil, and averſe from good.</hi> In ſuch paſſages as theſe there ſeem to be ſome glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings and dark reſemblances of <hi>Original Sin:</hi> But alas, poor Souls, they were ſar from a juſt ſenſe thereof; they did not underſtand the depth and venom of this wound, but thought there was <hi>Medicamentum in latere,</hi> enough in the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the ſelf-power of the Soul, which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> at his Converſion brought out of <hi>Plato's</hi> School into Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to heal it ſelf. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes Mans Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be <hi>the Operation of the Rational Soul according to Virtue;</hi> and that Virtue he ranks among the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63874:136"/>the Soul, Reaſon and Will being free and pure; hence they generally cry out againſt the Body as a Priſon, and the Senſes as fetters and manacles to the Immortal Spirit. <hi>Theophraſt</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>That the Soul paid a dear rent for her dwelling in the Body, conſidering how much it ſuffered at the Bodies hand.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> declaim againſt the Paſſions, as the <hi>ſickneſſes</hi> and <hi>languors</hi> of the Soul; all the load is laid upon <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the common people of the Soul,</hi> (as ſome call the Paſſions), as if the Princes, Reaſon and Will, were free, never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spiritual wickedneſſes which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Neither could it be expected, that they ſhould know the latitude of Sin, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had not the pure Law, but only ſome fragments of it in their hearts, by which they could no more diſcern the proportions of Sin, than a man can underſtand features by the broken pieces of a Picture.</p>
               <p>Leaving the Pagans, let us ſearch among the <hi>Jews,</hi> a People to whom the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were committed, there the Believers had a true ſenſe of Original Sin; <hi>David</hi> ſenſes it, <hi>in primo ardore,</hi> in the firſt warmth of Natural Conception, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. But ſuch among them as wanted Faith, wanted a ſenſe thereof. Indeed they had the Law, but the veil being on their hearts, they underſtood it only as prohibiting <hi>manum, non animum, the outward act, not the Will;</hi> and, <hi>Non concupiſces, Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> was rather taken tor a Moral ſentence, than a Divine precept among them.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63874:136"/>This was the opinion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Saviours time, when Rabbinical Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was at the height in the Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai;</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> a man brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the honour of the Law, while he was in his Pharifaiſm <hi>knew not concupiſcence to be Sin, Rom.</hi> 7.7. And they that underſtood the Law no better, could underſtand but little of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin. Their Circumciſion was a <hi>memento</hi> of it, and ſo they underſtood it, caſting the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putium</hi> thereby cut off into the duſt, <hi>as a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to feed the old Serpent withal.</hi> But alas, they were <hi>uncircumciſed in heart,</hi> and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count reckoned up among <hi>Egyptians.

                  <hi>the evil figment in mans heart,</hi> as an implacable enemy. <hi>One man</hi> (ſay they) <hi>walks with another but one hour, and they become friends, but this evil figment is born with man, and grows up with him all his days, and yet if it find an opportunity, will after</hi> 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 <hi>years, precipitate and caſt him down headlong.</hi> But they make it a very ſmall matter at firſt. <hi>At firſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>it is weak as a woman, afterwards ſtrong as a man; at firſt it is as a ſmall ahread, afterwards as the cable of a Ship; at firſt it is as a Viator, at laſt as a Lord.</hi> And withal they made it ſubject to the power of mans free will. <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> (ſay they) <hi>would fain ruin thee, but thou maiſt, if thou wilt, rule over it, Gen.</hi> 4. And <hi>whoſoever obeys the good figment,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63874:137"/>that is, his own reaſon, ſhall be delivered from the evil one.</hi> They cried up Reaſon and Will, and underſtood little of Original Sin; Hence Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, the neceſſity whereof may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deduced from a right knowledg of that Sin, was ſo unintelligible to them. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and one of the Judges in the great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> was ſtartled at our Saviours. Doctrine, <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.5. That of being born of water, poſſibly he might underſtand, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> did imitate their Proſelytes, by waſhing or Baptiſm, and then counted them as new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and regenerate, as Learned men have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But that of being born of the Spirit, he was totally ignorant of, which he could not have been had he had a true ſenſe of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin; which, where it is, makes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Regeneration obvious, but looking on that Sin as no great matter, and corrigible by mans own Reaſon and Will, he ſtood as it were at a maze at our Saviours words, as if there had been no promiſe at all of <hi>a new heart,</hi> and <hi>a new ſpirit</hi> made in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Leaving the <hi>Jews,</hi> let us enquire among Chriſtians for a true ſenſe of Original Sin; here we muſt not expect it among <hi>Pelagians</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> who deny the thing, as if the figment of the heart were but the figment of the brain: <hi>peccatum originis nullum prorſus eſt,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Racovian Catechiſm: Sine vitio naſcimur,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63874:137"/>
                  <hi>Pelagius,</hi> placing Infants in the ſame ſtate as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his Fall; neither muſt we look for it among thoſe <hi>Popiſh Doctors,</hi> who mince and extenuate this Sin, <hi>Intenſivè majus eſt peccatum actuale quam originale,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas:</hi> It is, <hi>Omnium peccatorum minimum,</hi> ſaith another. Hence many of them aſſert, That it is not properly Sin; neither may I find it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Proteſtant Doctors, who though they uſe the word Grace, yet attribute much to the Reaſon and Will of man. That famous place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, of <hi>being born of the Spirit,</hi> is taken by a learned man for <hi>an undertaking the Law of Chriſt, an entring on a new pure Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life;</hi> as if Regeneration were Mans act. <hi>The fallen man</hi> (ſaith another) <hi>is not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of power, but as the man in the Parable half-dead. Sin is not ſo unruly, but that</hi> Cain, <hi>if he will do well, may maſter it; the deſire of Sin ſhall be ſubject to him,</hi> ſaith God. When a Man came to <hi>Delphos</hi> with a live-Bird under his Cloak, and asked the Oracle, Whether he ſhould bring forth a dead thing or living? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to put a trick upon it: Anſwer was made to him, <hi>In te eſt ſtulte:</hi> Fool, 'tis in thy power to do which thou wilt. So ſay ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. The Goſpel is propoſed to Men, and to embrace it is in their own power; 'tis Gods part to call, but Mans to be elect or not; that is, to be ſincere Believers or not. Theſe Men to me underſtand little of Original Sin. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting them, I come to thoſe who have a right notion of Sin and Grace, but are void
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63874:138"/>of true Faith: Theſe with all the Balms and ſweet Odours of Truth which lie about their Heads, are yet Spiritually dead at Heart, and feel not their Wounds; they are as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their old Heart, and with caſe carry a ſink of Sin in their boſom: Oh how much unfelt, unbewailed blindneſs, hardneſs, enmity, unbelief, earthineſs is there in them! All which fetch never a groan from them. It is ſomewhat ſtrange that believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God made him ſo fair a promiſe of an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſhould yet let out his thoughts ſo much upon <hi>Iſhmael, Oh that Iſhmael might live before thee!</hi> But it is very natural for unregenerate men, even when the Promiſe of a new heart lies fair before them in the Scripture, to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the old frame, as much of Hell and Death as they carry about with them.

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith uſhers into the Soul a ſtock of gracious Principles,</hi> which conflict againſt the innate corruption, and labour to drive it out, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> by little and little; there is even in unregenerate Men, a conflict between Reaſon and the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Affections.<note place="margin">Ariſt.

                  </gap> will be in tumult in the Soul. In this natura conflict, Reaſon, if improved, to maintain it own grandeur and royalty, may by its Edict
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63874:139"/>huſh the tumults and mutinies in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and prevent many ſhames and turpitudes of Senſuality; but alas, there is nothing of true Mortification in all this, no, not in the Affections themſelves, which are not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, but only, as the Horſe and Mule, held in with the rational bit or bridle; much leſs in the Reaſon, in which there is a great deal of vanity, dark ignorance, proud curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, fleſhly wiſdom, vain philoſophy, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane folly, and perverſe contradiction; in all which, Reaſon will rather indulge than crucifie it ſelf; but Faith uſhers in another manner of Conflict. In the Natural Conflict Reaſon is General, and manages the War; and as the Reaſon is, ſo is the ſtrength in Battel, but Humane only: In the Spiritual Conflict, there is <hi>a greater than Reaſon,</hi> even Supernatural Grace; which being of Divine extraction, hath in it ſelf a power more than Humane to oppoſe corruption; and which yet makes it ſtronger, it hath continual Auxiliaries from the Holy Spirit, which is always ſtanding at the right hand of Grace, as Satan is of Corruption, to back and ſtrengthen it. In the Natural Conflict the fight is in a Logical and Argumentative way only; and Reaſon being corrupt, like a cunning Sophiſter, turns about and ſtands ever and anon on the ſame ſide with Sin; but in the Spiritual Conflict, there can be no ſuch compliances, the War is laid in nature, Grace in its very nature carries an enmity againſt corruption, and irreconcilably, interminably
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63874:140"/>oppoſes it, as long as Grace is Grace, and Sin Sin. In the Natural Conflict Reaſon fights but <hi>ex parte,</hi> only againſt the groſs, carnal, ſenſual luſts, which ſtain Humanity; in the mean time the pride, perverſneſs, and deſperate contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which dwell in the upper faculties, are altogether untouched. The Moraliſt ſtands upon bis own bottom, full of ſelf-power and ſelf-righteouſneſs; and becauſe he hath by his Reaſon conceived and brought forth ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues, Free-grace and its progeny, born after the Spirit, are deſpiſed in his eyes; than which temper, there is nothing more diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the Goſpel, which would have Men come in to Jeſus Chriſt <hi>weary, heavy laden, hungry, thirſty, poor in ſpirit;</hi> loſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſenſibly wanting all things: But in the Spiritual Conflict, the War is univerſal, Grace ſights againſt all Sin, not only againſt the groſs carnal luſts which have more of the beaſt in them, but againſt the fine Spiritual ones, which have more of the Devil; nor only againſt thoſe open Sins which face the World, but againſt thoſe ſecret ones which lie hid in the Heart. So oppoſite it is, that as in the War againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> it <hi>would deſtroy every thing that breaths.</hi> Sin in the firſt motions and titillations thereof, in the Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, the fight is between diſtinct faculties, Reaſon and Paſſion, and ſo is at a diſtance, and as it were by miſſile arms; but in the Spiritual Conflict, the fight is cloſe and immediate, there is ſomething of Grace in every faculty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63874:140"/>the corruption there. In the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is an Heavenly Wiſdom which counterplots the Earthly, as <hi>Huſhai</hi> did. <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophel,</hi> whileſt the one deſigns for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> the rebellious luſt in the Heart, the other ſtands up for the Kingdom of Chriſt, the true <hi>David.</hi> In the Will there is an holy Principle which bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linces the corrupt, and is as a counter-byaſs to the Heart, drawing it off from the falſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to the true. In the Affections there is a Divine ſpark, which makes them aſpire and elevate towards Heavenly things, whileſt the earthly part clogs and preſſes them down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In a word, Grace is ſpread all over the Soul, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were over <hi>Canaan,</hi> to drive out the old inhabitant, the corruption in every faculty. In the Natural Conflict, Man walks in his own Circle, the only deſigu is for the, Kingdom of Reaſon; and which is the common blaſt upon Morality, nothing is done <hi>in ordine ad Deum.</hi> In the Spiritual Conflict, the aim is all for God and Chriſt, that their Throne may be in the Heart, and all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies there, may be made their footſtool. Thus Grace, uſhered into the Soul by Faith, doth by little and little work out and extirpate Sin; as the day breaks upon the Heart, darkneſs goes off; as Holineſs flows in, Corruption departs; the more of Heaven is there, the leſs of Earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith diſcovers the great evil of Original Sin,</hi> and ſo raiſes up an hatred againſt it, and hatred is a murderer, and would, if it
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63874:141"/>could, annihilate its oppoſite; Faith ſhews it to be an <hi>All-evil,</hi> a <hi>Mother of abominations.</hi> Some particular Sins are ſuch monſters in Morality, that when viewed only in the light of Nature, they appear very odious; ſuch was the cruelty of <hi>Nero,</hi> Effeminacy of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and the like; much more odious, when inſpected by the light of Faith, muſt that appear which is All-ſin in one, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or univerſal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of iniquity. <hi>Anthony</hi> holding <hi>Caeſars</hi> bloody Coat up to the People, moved them againſt the Conſpirators; Faith holding up the Murders, Adulteries, Blaſphemies, Villanies in the World, unto the Believers eyes, ſtirs his Heart againſt the venemous root of all theſe. Faith ſhews it to be an univerſal evil, all over the Soul, breaking forth like the boyls of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon man and upon beaſt, upon the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and ſenſitive faculties, and all over the Believers duties; lying as the locuſts there upon every herb and green thing, upon the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and glory of every good work; it is a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in the Believers eye, a plague in his Heart, an ataxy in his Affections, a damp on his Prayers, a cooler to his Charity and Zeal, and a dead fly in all the precious Oyntment of his duties and good works. Faith ſhews it to be an utter enemy to God, <hi>Antichriſt-like,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every appearance of him in the Heart, quenching every good motion, trampling on every holy beam, ſlighting at the two great periods of Mankind, Heaven and Hell; and jeering at that holineſs and iniquity which lead
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63874:141"/>thither: Faith ſhews it to be an evil always preſent; the Believer ſhakes himſelf, and it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers; flys, and it encompaſſes; mortifies, and it lives; prays, weeps, ſweats, and fights, and yet the <hi>Canaanite is in the land;</hi> like a living man chained to a dead, he carries about his own loathſomneſs, a body of death all his days; this cleaves to him as the blackneſs to the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian,</hi> and as the fretting ſpreading Leprofie to the houſe; after all his waſhing and ſcraping of himſelf, it will yet be in him, till death diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him into duſt: Such repreſentations as theſe made by Faith, fill the Believer with ſhame and ſelf-abhorrency, and raiſe up in him an irreconcileable hatred againſt it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith, ſo far as it is acted, though it make not a total riddance of it, doth yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon it,</hi> that it cannot go at large and riot in ſcandalous Sins. No, nor ſteal out in an evil thought, but it will be arreſted in its paſſage to the Will for a conſent; as it was Gods cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beware that there be not a thought in thy <hi>Belial</hi>-heart againſt Charity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.9. So it is Faiths endeavour to ſtop corruption even in a thought; the fleſh is ſtill a luſting, and would have one piece of forbidden fruit or other in its mouth; but Faith oppoſes, and would, if it could, leave nothing of it to breath in the Believer: This is that the Scripture calls, <hi>The crucifying of the old man;</hi> Faith arraigns the old man as the Arch-malefactor in the World, condemns him as worthy to die; ſtrips him of his veils and falſe coverings, and by
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63874:142"/>holy reſtraints nails him to the Croſs, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in a ſlumber of Faith, he cannot move or ſtir himſelf, but dies away by little and little. As the light of Nature, being <hi>impriſoned in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, is every day exhauſted and weakned; ſo the corruption of Nature being thus reſtrained by Faith, gradually loſes its life and vigor. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Polonus</hi> tels of a terrible Dragon at <hi>Rome,</hi> who killed many daily with his poyſonous breath, but was at laſt ſhut up with Braſen gates through the Prayers of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> Biſhop there. Were this Fable true, Faith doth a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler work in reſtraining the inward Serpent of corruption, whoſe deadly poyſon hath ſpread it ſelf over all Men, and is eternally fatal to all but Believers.</p>
               <p>To conclude; In all this, Faith applies it ſelf to a Crucified Chriſt, from thence it fetches its pattern: As the pure fleſh of Chriſt, upon which, as an expiatory Sacrifice, the Sin of the World was laid, ſuffered on the Croſs; ſo the corrupt fleſh of Man, unto which, as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Seminary, the Sin of the World may be juſtly imputed, muſt ſuffer alſo: Hence Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. From <hi>the ſuffering of Chriſt in the fleſh, exhorts Believers to ſuffer in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fleſh, ceaſing from Sin,</hi> and from thence it derives a ſpirit for the work. Chriſt offered himſelf <hi>through the eternal Spirit</hi> on the Croſs; and the Believer through the Spirit of Chriſt, offers up his corrupt ſelf to be crucified. Hence St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6.6. ſaith, <hi>Our old man is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:63874:142"/>with him;</hi> that is, by a ſecret virtue drawn from his Croſs.</p>
               <p>Thus far of this Fundamental Mortification; I now come to particular Sins, which are but the foul iſſues of Original, breaking forth in this or that, as temper, education, place, cuſtom, or other accidents give vent thereunto; theſe alſo doth Faith mortifie, and that in ſome ſuch way as this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith doth reſtrain the outward acts of Sin;</hi> there may be many reſtraints in which yet there is nothing of Mortification; one Sin may reſtrain another, <hi>Vitia inter ſe contraria pugnant;</hi> in which caſe <hi>Satan caſts out Satan,</hi> a predominant luſt its oppoſite. The fiery Law with its threats may meet a man in his perverſe way, as the Angel with his drawn Sword did <hi>Balaam,</hi> and turn him back from committing the act; nevertheleſs the unchanged Heart hankers and inwardly mourns after it, as <hi>Phal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel</hi> did after <hi>Michal,</hi> when ſhe was forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him; and which is a better reſtraint, becauſe meerly from an in ward principle, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtue may hold him back from it, as it did <hi>Abimelech</hi> from <hi>Sarah;</hi> yet this reſtraint is but partial, only from outward Sins of ſhame, and withal ſelfiſh, aiming at no higher thing than repute and ſelf-excellency: But Faith reſtrains upon higher and nobler Motives, ſpeaking to the temptation as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Miſtreſs, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> May I break his Law, which is more than the Interdicts of all the Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63874:143"/>of the World? or ſtain his glory, which is more precious than the light of the Sun, Moon and Stars? or trample on that precious Blood, which paid my ranſom from Hell and Death? or grieve away that Spirit which is the life of all my Graces and Comforts? or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute this Heart, which may be a Temple or Tabernacle for the Holy One to dwell in? or run my ſelf again into the pangs of the New Birth, and forget the wormwood and gall of my old Sins, and eclypſe the light of Gods Countenance towards me, and lye down in the diſmal borders of Hell and Death? How can I do it? Such a reſtraint as this, is a degree of Mortification; Sin begins to die, when ſuch chains and manacles as theſe are caſt upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith doth not only reſtrain the outward acts of Sin, but ſtrikes at the life of it; that is, the love thereof;</hi> and to this end Faith clearly demonſtrates, that Sin is not eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, or an object fit for an Humane Will; Sin ſhews it ſelf as eligible many ways, but Faith deſtroys all thoſe eligibilities. Take Sin as meer Sin in the abſtract, and ſo it is evil and only evil; and as the Schools generally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>Sub ratione mali,</hi> it is not, it cannot be eligible at all; and yet even in the notion of meer Sin, it becomes eligible, <hi>Sub ratione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venientiae,</hi> as it is congruous to the corrupt Heart of Man. The <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> Errors are welcome meerly as Paraſites to the pride of Reaſon and Will. In Sins of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63874:143"/>the very neglect gratifies Mans averſneſs from good; in Sins of Commiſſion, the very violation of the Law complies with his enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereunto. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Confeſſions,<note place="margin">Lib. 2: cap. 4.</note> ſays, That he ſtole Apples, that he might, <hi>Frui non re ipſa, ſed furto;</hi> that he was, <hi>Gratis malus, &amp; amavit defectum ſuum;</hi> caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Apples, he feaſted on the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; or if he took any of them into his mouth, <hi>Condimentum facinus erat,</hi> Sin was the only fawce thereof. Man drinketh in iniquity like water; the very ſinfulneſs is connatural. This eligibility before Faith muſt needs be very ſtrong: for to Man in the pride and ſelf-flattery of Nature, nothing is ſweeter or dearer, than to walk in the way of his Heart, as abſolute unaccountable Lord of all his Actions; but when Faith comes, then it clearly appears, that the corrupt Heart, into which Sin inſinuates by congruity, is too vile a thing to be gratified; it ſteals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from holy Duties, plays falſe after fair promiſes, hatches treaſon and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and like a common Strumpet proſtitutes it ſelf to every temptation that paſſes by; to gratifie it, is to feed a diſeaſe, or vicious humour, ſatisfie a grave or gulf of inordinate deſires; put the <hi>darling Soul</hi> into the mouth of Satan, and deſperately leap into the bottomleſs pit: that corruption to which Sin is ſo grateful, is an accurſed thing, deſtinated by the Goſpel to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſlain without mercy; and thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63874:144"/>of it, which after the greateſt mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations remain, are to be mourned and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under as the heavieſt burden in the world. What the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> fringes did typifie, that the Chriſtians Faith operates, in keeping men from ſeeking after their own heart; but to go on, take ſin not as meer ſin, but in the dreſs of ſome apparent good; let it be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a well-circumſtanced Sin,</hi> as a learned man takes that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, flowing in riches, or rowling in ſenſual pleaſures, or holding forth Crowns and Scepters, and all Mundane glory; nay, if it were poſſible, let it inveſt it ſelf with a Creation, all the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er World cannot make it eligible to Faith. Set down a World, if Faith ſubſtract but a <hi>God or a Soul,</hi> what will remain but <hi>infinite damage?</hi> thoſe treaſures, which glitter ſo much to dark ſenſe, are to Faith but poor ruſty moth-eaten things; that which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the World, is to Faith but a ſhadow, an apparition, a thing that is not, a mark too low for an Immortal Soul to fly at: Theſe things at preſent and in the Now-World ſeem ſomething; but if Faith look through the World unto the univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration, and beyond it to the World to come, what will they ſignifie? Are they able to ſurvive thoſe laſt flames, or purchaſe any thing in the World to come? Surely juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; except only ſo much thereof as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed thither in Charity and good Works: to Faith the whole inventory of them is but a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63874:144"/>great cheat; the Riches are not the true ones; the Gold is not that tried in the fire; the Land doth not lie in the Country which Faith ſeeks after; there is nothing in them to feed or cloth, or enrich the inward man; and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a God or a Soul for them, muſt needs be an infinite loſs. And what are the pleaſures of this World to Faith? In carnal Sins, they are but the titillations of ſenſe, in which the Rational faculties, were they not Spiritually incarnate and become fleſh, would have no touch of delight: In Spiritual Sins, they are but the falſe guſts of a vitiated Reaſon and Will, which if made right by Faith, find no congruity but in what is true and good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which can be in a Sin: In both, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany as they are, <hi>they periſh in the uſing,</hi> and die in the embraces; like the dead Son of the Emperour <hi>Baſilius Macedo,</hi> who being Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally preſented to his Father as alive, after a few touches and doting glances, diſappeared; ſo they go off, only they leave a ſting and a worm behind them in Conſcience; and the poor Voluptary, without repentance, muſt lie down in eternal ſorrow, a thought whereof is enough to imbitter all their ſweetneſs: And are Mundane glories any better in Faiths account? Honour is but a blaſt, a little popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar air; Monarchies have their periods; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory gives us a proſpect of their vanity; and much more Faith, which tranſlates the Soul into the everlaſting Kingdom, and from thence looks on the Empires of the World
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63874:145"/>as the chaff of the Summer-floor, rolling away with the wind of time. To a man up among the Stars, the whole Earth would be but as a ſmall thing, and ſuch are Crowns and Scepters to one converſing in Heaven; in the midſt of them a man may want true greatneſs; the Worlds <hi>Epiphanes</hi> may be but <hi>a vile perſon,</hi> a ſlave to his luſts, which is the greateſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude; at death he may, like <hi>Adrian,</hi> moan over his little Soul, and at Judgment cry out <hi>to the rocks and mountains to fall upon him, and cover him from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> But to proceed, and take Sin in another dreſs; let it come as a worldly Saviour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it, and you ſhall be delivered from loſſes, reproaches, racks, perſecuting flames, and cruel deaths; it will not yet be eligible. Faith in the love of its eſpouſals, and upon the firſt contract received a whole Chriſt, Croſs and all, and ſo virtually and in purpoſe hath already ſwallowed down all perſecutions which go along with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and when the actual trial comes, Faith will not eſcape by iniquity, which is an evil tranſcendently greater than all the reſt, and whileſt it outwardly, temporally ſaves, inwardly, eternally deſtroys: To Faith there is no loſs like that of a Soul, no reproach like Sins turpitude; no racks like thoſe in Conſcience; no flames or deaths like thoſe in Hell: Which made thoſe tormented Worthies <hi>not accept deliverance,</hi> Heb. 11.35. Sin is meer Sin, totally, perfectly evil; but ſuffering
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63874:145"/>for the Goſpel is not meer ſuffering: In tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral loſſes, there may be eternal gain; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, a ſpirit of glory; in outward racks, inward joys. In the Burning-buſh God may dwell; and death may open a door to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Hence come the famous Triumphs of Martyrs; the Apoſtle <hi>rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for Chriſt,</hi> Act. 5.41: In the Original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Thus Faith deſtroys all Sins eligibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and in ſo doing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>overcomes the World,</hi> which is the pureſt of Victories. The great ones, who captivated the World outwardly and martially, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves captivated by it, in one luſt or other, Not unlike <hi>Amaziah,</hi> who ſubdued the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and was himſelf taken with their gods: But Faith, which overcomes inwardly and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, ſubdues the luſts themſelves.</p>
               <p>Further, yet Faith doth not only ſtrike at the love of Sin, by deſtroying its eligibilities, but by ſurrendring the Heart to a better Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; whileſt the love and joy, and delight is in Sin, it lives as a body with a ſpirit in it; but when theſe are ſurrendred up to God and Chriſt, and Heavenly things, it becomes ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate as a dead Carcaſe. This was notably
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63874:146"/>deciphered in Chriſt crucified, the grand pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of our Mortification; he was not only ſtript and nailed, but <hi>commending his Spirit to God be gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> Anſwerably in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification Sin is not only ſtript of its eligibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and nailed by reſtraints, but it dies away in the ſurrenders of Faith; by which the Soul <hi>Enoch-like is tranſlated into Heaven,</hi> and its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not here below to animate Sin. Were this ſurrender in perfection, Sin could not ſo much as be, as is evident in Chriſts Humane Nature, upon which no ſpot could fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ever was in perfect ſurrender to his Father. And proportionably, where it is but in truth only Sin is a-dying; becauſe the love and joy, whileſt in the raptures and triumphs of Faith, afford no quickning thereunto: hence the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Walk in the ſpirit,</hi> in the elevations of Faith and other Graces, <hi>and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſt of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. Sin ſhall grow heartleſs, and be able to do little or nothing. Here we ſee how the dear intimate luſts come to die; they ceaſe to be dear as Faith turns the ſtream of the Heart; and give up the Ghoſt, as the love and the joy go out to God. It was <hi>Luthers</hi> method in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that firſt the Images were to be removed out of the minds of Men, and then all would ſuceed; and it is Faiths method in Mortification, by holy ſurrenders to ſever the Heart from its luſts, and ſo do the work. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Faith caſts out the love of Sin by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing in the holy Word; after which the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63874:146"/>Soul becomes pure and ſhining like <hi>Moſes</hi> face after he had been with God; converſing with the Law, it ſees a rectitude and pure ſplendor; and then to love Sin is to embrace crookedneſs and helliſh darkneſs; and withal it ſees wrath and vengeance threatned againſt tranſgreſſors: and then to love Sin is to take death and hell into our boſom. Converſing with the Goſpel, it hath ſuch a fair proſpect of Grace and Chriſt, as renders Sin the moſt ungrateful and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing in the World: Shall God give up his Son, his eternal joy to die upon a croſs; and a man, a worm, ſpare a luſt, a brat of his corrupt Heart? Shall Chriſt pour out his Blood and very Soul to expiate Sin, and a Believer, a redeemed one, fall in love with the Crucifier? Shall the holy Spirit come down and dwell in Man as his Temple; and he, who is ſo honoured, embrace that which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offence and grievance to ſuch a gueſt? Or ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven come down and offer it ſelf; and that, which is the only bar and obſtacle, be received? Surely a Believer with his eyes open will not do ſo; the more of converſe he hath with the Word, the leſs of the love of Sin. As Senſe, when it lies broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Creature, inflames the love of Sin: So Faith, when it dwells on the Word, abates it; that Concupiſcence which at firſt crept in upon <hi>Eve</hi> in a ſlumber of Faith, while Senſe was doting on the fruit, muſt be driven out again by Faith, fixing on the Word, and ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting above ſenſible things.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:63874:147"/>
               <p>Thus far how Faith ſtrikes at the love of Sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith mortifies Sin by watching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the occaſions and inducements thereof.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were not to name the Idol-gods; the <hi>Nazarite</hi> was to abſtain from the very husk of the grape. <hi>Valentinian</hi> could not bear a little drop of <hi>Julians</hi> holy-water, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſprinkled on his garment without dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. The Children of <hi>Samoſatane</hi> would not play with their Ball after the Aſs of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Biſhop <hi>Lucius</hi> had trod on it, but burnt it in the Market-place as unclean. Faith is nice and curious, it will not go in with ſuch a diſſembler, nor come nigh the door of ſuch an Harlot as Sin is; knowing that the Soul may ſoon be cheated and adulterated thereby. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of danger make men watch; and to Faith there is no danger like that of Sin: <hi>If the good man of the houſe had known when the thief would come, he would have watched,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.43. Faith knows Sin to be a thief, and a murderer to the Soul; and therefore ſets guards within and without, that it may not creep in by the ports of Senſe, nor riſe up out of the deep of the Heart. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a watch over the Thoughts, and without over the ſenſible Objects. And if a ſnare appear, Faith cries out, as the ſuffering Martyr did, when a Box with a Pardon in it was ſet before him, <hi>Away with it, as you love my Soul.</hi> During this watch Sin pines and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes away as in a Spiritual ſiege; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:63874:147"/>commerce between the Thoughts and the Objects fails, and with it thoſe proviſions which uſe to be made for the fleſh. Hence our Saviour would have his Diſciples, <hi>To watch and pray that they might not enter into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Temptations will offer themſelves, but the watching Believer will not enter into them by a conſent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith mortifies Sin by thoſe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Grace which it puts forth in the Believer.</hi> As Sin the more it is acted makes the fuller blot on the Soul; ſo Grace, the more it is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaves the purer tincture there: <hi>You have purified your Souls in obeying the truth,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.22. Every act of Grace or Obedience doth in its meaſure purifie from Sin. <hi>The righteous holds on his way, and ſo grows ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9. The exerciſe of Grace renders the inner man more ſtrong and able to drive out Corruption; eſpecially when that Grace is acted, which beſides its purifying, ſtrengthening nature in common with other Graces, is contrary to the Sin which is to be mortified; and ſo proper and apt to expel it, as one contrary doth another. Hence <hi>Daniel</hi> counſels <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>break off his ſins by righteouſneſs and mercy,</hi> Dan. 4.27: his Sins being Oppreſſion and Cruelty, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was apter than Righteouſneſs &amp; Mercy to break them off. And our Saviour when his Diſciples were fainting in the ſtorm, calls for their Faith: And when aſpiring after the Primacy, <hi>ſets a little child before them,</hi> as an
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63874:148"/>emblem of Humility. Dying-<hi>Sardis</hi> he puts upon <hi>ſtrengthening the things which remain;</hi> and Nentral <hi>Laodicea</hi> upon <hi>Zeal,</hi> to give her a freſh warmth in Religion. Still the advice runs upon the contrary Grace; the more that is actuated, the more it roots and ſpreads in the Soul, and the leſs room and place is left there for the contrary Sin: Which I ſuppoſe was the reaſon why the Presbyter <hi>Sulpitius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> being guilty of too much Loquacity, ever after kept ſilence;<note place="margin">Spondan. Annal.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t peccatum, quod lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo contraxerat, tacendo emendaret,</hi> as the Hiſtorian expreſſes it. 'Tis a Precept of the Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Eth. lib. 2. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>To obſerve what Vice we are moſt propenſe to, and then to bend our ſelves to the contrary extream, that we might come to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the middle.</hi> Faith, though it dares not touch upon one contrary Sin to cure another, would caſt them both out by acting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Faith mortifies Sin in a way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Power and Spirit of God in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the Covenant of Works, in which there was no Mediator, Man ſtood on his own bottom, and had all his ſtock in his own hands: But in the Covenant of Grace the Believer ſtands in the Power of God; and though he have a little Grace in himſelf, the main ſtock is above in a ſurer hand; <hi>his life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> there's the great treaſure out of which Faith fetches ſupplies of the Spirit for every good work; hence in Scripture he is ſaid, <hi>To love, live, pray,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63874:148"/>walk, mortifie in the ſpirit: If ye through the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. He ſaith, <hi>through the Spirit,</hi> becauſe there is no other way of mortifying Sin; he that goes about this work in his own Power is but in a dream, he knows nothing of the life of Faith; as appears by that <hi>Antitheſis</hi> which the Prophet makes between <hi>the Soul lifted up, and the life of Faith,</hi> Hab. 2.4. Such an one <hi>holds not the head Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> no more than the <hi>worſhippers of Angels</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 19. Whatever he may do theoretically, he doth it not practically; whileſt his <hi>fleſhly mind</hi> preſumes, that he can move about ſuch a work, though the <hi>Head in Heaven</hi> ſtir not, his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification muſt needs be weak and powerleſs; becauſe without Chriſt <hi>the wiſdom and power of God,</hi> he goes out againſt his luſts, as <hi>Samſon</hi> did againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> with his hair off; or, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did againſt the <hi>Canaanites</hi> when <hi>the Lord was not among them,</hi> Numb. 14.32, inſtead of ſucceſs he meets with that curſe and blaſt, which lights upon all Chriſtlleſs perſons and actions: The moſt charitable Prayer that can be made for him is that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name, O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 83.16. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> long ſtruggled in his own ſtrength againſt his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and all in vain; at laſt a voice told him, <hi>In te ſtas &amp; non ſtas: Thou falleſt, O</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, <hi>by ſtanding in thy ſelf.</hi> True Faith goes about this work in the Power and Spirit of Chriſt; as under the Old Teſtament, when
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63874:149"/>
                  <hi>Faith ſubdued outward Kingdoms,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, Heb. 11.33, it was <hi>by the Spirit; the Spirit clothed upon Gideon,</hi> and he ſmote a mighty Hoſt of <hi>Midianites.</hi> The <hi>Spirit came upon</hi> Samſon, <hi>and he ſlew heaps upon heaps of the Philiſtines.</hi> So under the New, when Faith ſubdues the inward Kingdom of Sin, it is by the Spirit ſtrengthening the Believer to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; the reign of Sin is broken, becauſe he is under Grace. Here we ſee how old ſtrong cuſtomary Sins, ſuch as are a ſecond nature in Men, come to be ſubdued; it would be an hard, nay almoſt impoſſible thing for a Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt to unravel ſuch a Sin, meerly by contrary acts, and thoſe acts done by his own power, and that power emaſculated by a long tract of Sin: But Faith draws down an Almighty Power and Spirit to the work; that <hi>hyperbole of Power which raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, is towards the Believer,</hi> Epheſ. 1.19. <hi>That Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life which is in Chriſt, makes him free from the law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 8.2, The bands of Sin can no more hold him than thoſe of Death could Chriſt, when <hi>the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> came to raiſe him up. In doing this great work Faith goes by theſe ſteps; firſt, Faith lays down this as a foundation, That there is Power enough in God to ſubdue Sin, or elſe he ſhould not be an Infinite God; and that Sin is capable of being ſubdued, or elſe it would be an Infinite Monſter. That Power which can dry up the Sea, or ſhake the Earth out of her place, or raiſe up the Dead out of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63874:149"/>the duſt, or annihilate the World in a moment, muſt be able to ſubdue Sin. In the Prophet it is but the turn of his hand, <hi>I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away they droſs,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.25. And which comes nearer to us, Faith is ſure, that this Power doth not ſtand off at a diſtance in the unapproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable Deity; but is made over to Chriſt, coming in the fleſh, <hi>He was anointed with the Holy Ghoſt and Power. The fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt in him bodily.</hi> And going up to Heaven, <hi>he ſate down at the right hand of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, all things being put under his feet.</hi> And which yet is nearer, this Power is made over to Chriſt as truſtee and treaurer for his Church; his Unction is to run down upon all Believers: The fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him, that they might be filled with it. He ſits at the right hand of Power, <hi>that his enemies,</hi> among which Sin is a chief one, <hi>may be made his footſtool:</hi> All things are put under him, <hi>that he might be Head over all to the Church,</hi> letting down his vital influences and motions to it; his great deſign is, <hi>to make an end of Sin, and to diſſolve the works of the Devil.</hi> And now nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to draw down this Power to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but the acting of Faith; as Faith goes up, Power comes down; all things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Believer, <hi>he can do all through Chriſt ſtrengthening him:</hi> It is but to look and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, believe and be eſtabliſhed, wait and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new ſtrength; hand upon Jeſus Chriſt, and he who was <hi>Immanuel, God with us</hi> in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63874:150"/>will be <hi>Immanuel, God with us</hi> in ſuch ſufficient Grace as ſhall give us the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sin; the ſucceſs is as ſure as the Spirit and Power of God can make it. When Chriſt was on Earth never any one came to him for bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cure, with a Faith that he was able to do it, but it was done for him. Now that he is in Heaven at the right hand of Power, ſuch as go in Faith for Spiritual Cures cannot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry. What though the bloody iſſue of Sin have been long a-running? a touch upon Chriſt will heal. What if thou haſt lay'n rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in thy Corruptions many years? believe and thou ſhalt ſee the glory of God raiſing thee up; a dependence on the Power and Spirit of Chriſt cannot fail of a victory over Sin. So vaſt is the difference between the ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, and the ſtate of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt; in him one Sin drove out a great ſtock of pure immaculate Grace in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in them a little ſpark of Grace drives out a world of Sin; becauſe their Grace, which <hi>Adams</hi> did not, depends on the Power and Spirit of Chriſt for the victory. This is a moſt noble and purely Evangelical act of Faith, in which Man is abaſed in a continual dependence, and God exalted in a continual ſupply of Grace. However, ſome Divines, falſly ſo called, have laughed at the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Faith as an idle lolling upon Chriſt; it is yet the only way in which the Spirit and Power of God communicates to our neceſſities, and does far more in the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:63874:150"/>Chriſtians life than any thing elſe: Only we muſt remember, that this dependence is in the uſe of means; the Believer hears, reads, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, prays, works, and in all depends upon the Spirit to render them effectual.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THus far of <hi>Mortification</hi> as a fruit of Faith. I now proceed to <hi>Vivification,</hi> being the other part of Sanctification. In which the holy Spirit comes down with its Divine Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the Soul, and quickens it to a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life. Theſe Graces may be conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their in their <hi>production into being,</hi> or in their <hi>actual exerciſe;</hi> and both ways they are fruits of Faith. As to their production into being, Divines differ about the order; ſome Divines, as Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> conceive, <hi>That all Graces are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed at once, coming into us as light doth into the air, or as the Soul did into the body of</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, <hi>not piece-meal or by degrees, but all at once and together.</hi> Other ſet down this order, <hi>Vocation which worketh Faith and Repentance, is in order of nature before Juſtification, and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before Sanctification.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:63874:151"/>diſtinguiſhes <hi>between our Spiritual conception of the incorruptible ſeed, and our new-birth in which Chriſt is formed in us in all his Graces; the former is done in our Vocation, and the latter in our Sanctification.</hi> I conceive that Faith, at leaſt in order of Nature, is firſt, and then all other Graces follow upon it. The Ancient Fathers, as Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> hath obſerved, ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe: In <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> Faith is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>the beginning of life;</hi> as it were the <hi>Punctum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens</hi> in the New Creature, in which the firſt motion and courſe of Spiritual life begins. <hi>Vita ſancta à fide ſumit initium,</hi> ſaith <hi>Fulgentius.</hi> And <hi>Fides prima datur, ex quá extera impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trantur,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> All other Graces are the fruits of Faith, not as if Faith did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them radically or fontally out of it ſelf, or its own virtue; but that it unites to Chriſt, and ſo derives the Spirit with its Graces unto the Believer. That Faith is, at leaſt in nature, before other Graces, will appear very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon divers Congruities:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is congruous to the Majeſty of God:</hi> He acts like himſelf, diſpences Grace to the Creature in its loweſt poſture of reſignation: <hi>Heaven is my throne, Earth my footſtool,</hi> ſaith he; but as over-looking all this World, <hi>To this man will I look that is poor and of a contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Iſa. 66.1, 2; <hi>To this man,</hi> there he ſets a nobler creation than this outward one. When
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63874:151"/>Faith makes a man poor and contrite, ſenſibly lying in his own Nothingneſs and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then creating Grace comes upon him. We may ſee this as in a glaſs in the Homane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt: That which had no natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of its own but ſubſiſted in the Eternal Word; that had the Spirit poured out upon it above meaſure. When a man hath no Moral ſubſiſtence of his own; his very <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> being a reſignation; when his ſubſiſtence is in the Word of God according to that of the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Have thy being in theſe things,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. Then the holy Spirit comes down and dwells in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is congruous to Chriſt the Head:</hi> Union goes before Communion; firſt, Faith unites us to Chriſt, and then all Graces flow from him: hence Faith is called the Churches <hi>neck, Cant.</hi> 4.4. knitting to Chriſt the Head, and from thence deriving all Spiritual life into the body of Believers. This alſo is ſet before us in Chriſts Humane Nature, which had firſt, at leaſt in nature, the Grace of Union, and then that of Unction; <hi>He that is in Chriſt is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. made ſo by his being in Chriſt; <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. Hath it by having the Son. Indeed Faith and Repentance go before our Union with Chriſt, as being of neceſſity thereunto; but all other Graces follow after it, as moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flowing from Chriſt the Head, <hi>of whoſe fulneſs</hi> all Believers <hi>receive Grace for Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is congruous to the way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63874:152"/>ſet forth in the Goſpel:</hi> The Spirit moves on the Soul to bring forth Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but it dwells no-where but in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; <hi>Chriſt dwells in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17.

                     </gap>, Vide Bez. &amp; Zanch.</note> as the <hi>Greek</hi> word imports; <hi>He that believeth on me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water,</hi> Joh. 7.38. And what theſe rivers are, the next verſe tells us, <hi>This he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> Faith brings in the very fountain of Grace with all its ſtreams into the Heart; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt is given to them that obey him,</hi> Act. 5.32; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to them that hear him,</hi> in the Goſpel-command; that is, to them that believe; ſo <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> expound it, and ſo the <hi>Syriack</hi> hath it. The Holy Ghoſt works before to produce Faith and Repentance; but it is not given to dwell in men until they believe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is congruous to the order which is between Faith, Juſtification and Sanctification.</hi> Faith is in order before Juſtification, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is expreſs in it; <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is upon them that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22. <hi>All that believe are juſtified,</hi> Act. 13.39. <hi>And we have believed that we might be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. And Juſtification is in order before Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I ſuppoſe the Holy Spirit with its Graces will not dwell in an unreconciled Soul. Under the Law in cleanſing the Leper, firſt the Prieſt put the blood on him, and then the holy oyl upon the place, where the blood was, <hi>Levit.</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:63874:152"/>14.14, &amp; 17. The Believer firſt in order hath the atoning Blood put on him, and then the holy Unction of the Spirit. According to this order Faith is firſt of all; But if Faith and all other Graces are infuſed at once and together, then either they are infuſed before Juſtification, and ſo Sanctification is before Juſtification; or elſe after it, and ſo Juſtification is before Faith.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>This way there will be a congruity between the old Creatiowand the new.</hi> In the old, Light was the firſt-born of the Creation, and then the other parts of the World were made; in the new, the firſt thing is the light of Faith, and then follow thoſe Graces which make up the New Creature; <hi>Beholding as in a glaſs the glory of God, we are changed into his image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.16. Firſt the eye of Faith is opened, and then the Image of God drawn on the Soul; this congruity is the rather to be minded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Creation of Faith, doth it with an alluſion to the Creation of Light. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. As if he had ſaid; Light in the old Creation, and Faith in the new anſwer one to another.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>This way there will be a congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt formed in the womb, and Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the beart.</hi> The bleſſed Virgin firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and then Chriſt was formed in her Womb: <hi>Concetio Chriſti facta fuit, ſimul ac</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:63874:153"/>Maria <hi>in verba Angeli conſentiens dixit; Ecce ancilla Domini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. lib. 2. Queſt. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>ſiat mihi ſecundum verbum tuum, Luk.</hi> 1.38. ſaith <hi>Zanchy.</hi> No ſooner did ſhe ſay an <hi>Amen</hi> of Faith to the Promiſe, but Chriſt was conceived in her; therefore after her Faith, the Angel immediately departed from her, as having his errand already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched: anſwerably the Chriſtian firſt believes, and then Chriſt is formed in him in all thoſe ſanctifying Graces which make up the holy Image of Chriſt. The Apoſtles expreſſing thoſe Graces under the notion of <hi>forming Chriſt in us,</hi> Gal. 4.19. ſeems to hint out this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>This way there will be a Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the being of theſe Graces, and the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them;</hi> whileſt both proceed from Faith depending upon Chriſt the head of Grace. The Believers life is in Scripture called <hi>a life of Faith;</hi> not as if there were not Love, Meekneſs, Obedience, Patience, with all the other Graces in him, but becauſe Faith is the grand princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which moves every one of them. <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. and ſo it worketh by Meekneſs, Obedience, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and all other Graces, being as it were blood and ſpirits running in every part of the New Creature. All Graces are ſet a working by Faith, and if they alſo receive their being through it, there is a Congruity between their being and working.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Congruities I take it, that Faith is firſt in order, and then other Graces.</p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:63874:153"/>
               <p>As to the actual exerciſe of Graces, It is Faith which ſets them all a working. To this purpoſe it is obſervable, That all the worthy acts of Grace mentioned in the <hi>11th.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> are there aſcribed to Faith: ſo is <hi>Abels excellent Sacrifice.</hi> Enochs <hi>walking with God,</hi> Noahs <hi>holy fear of the deluge,</hi> Abrahams <hi>obedience in leaving his Country,</hi> Moſes<hi>'s ſelf-denial as to the</hi> Egyptian <hi>Court, The valour of ſome Worthies in ſubduing Kingdoms; and the patience of others in ſuffering torments for the truth.</hi> The reaſon of which is, becauſe Faith is the firſt mover, which ſets all other Graces a-moving, the General under whoſe conduct all Graces come forth in their courſes, therfore the honour of all is devolved upon it. Now, how Faith ſets other Graces a-working, I ſhall firſt ſhew in a general way common to all of them, and then more particularly with reſpect to ſome ſpecial Graces. In general Faith ſets other Graces in motion by ſuch ways as theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It looks on the Command which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls for theſe Graces, as the very Will of God:</hi> And ſo preſſes for Obedience many ways; as firſt from the Divine Authority of it, <hi>In the word of a King there is power,</hi> much more <hi>in the word of a God,</hi> when known to be ſuch. In the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Triburia</hi> a fancy touching an Epiſile come from Heaven made impreſſion in ſome of them. Had it been really known to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the impreſſion would have been deeper. At the ſound of the Command Faith knows,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63874:154"/>that it is the Lord, that the voice is <hi>from the excellent glory;</hi> and in that Authority preſſes to Obedience. But this is not all, beſides Gods Authority, it urges from his Love. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith Faith) <hi>the voice of thy beloved,</hi> thy dear Father in Heaven, who hath caſt his cords and bands of Love round about thee to draw thee to himſelf; and then the Heart muſt needs feel conſtraints and holy inflammations to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and be like St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who, when he knew it was the Lord, girt himſelf, and made towards him. Gods Love hath dropt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the Command, and made all eaſie. Moreover, to make the ſtronger impulſe on the Believer, Faith demonſtrates, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is juſt, and right, and good; that holy Love and Patience, and other Graces of the firſt Table are pure rectitudes wherein Man ſtands in his true poſture towards God, his Goodneſs or Providence, or ſome other thing in him: And alſo that Juſtice and Temperance, and Charity are rectitudes wherein he ſtands in a true poſture towards others, or himſelf for Gods ſake. And a Command ſo known moves ſo ſtrongly towards Obedience, that a man, who would pay his debts to God, or his Neighbour, or himſelf, cannot, muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith looks not only upon the letter of the Command, but upon the life of Chriſt.</hi> Where all Graces are ſet forth in lively and orient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, really and practically exemplified to our view. Precepts poſſibly may have more of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63874:154"/>notion in them, but Examples have more of vivacity to attract the heart to imitation: above all the Example of Chriſt muſt be cogent to Believers, <hi>he went up and down doing of good;</hi> every ſtep one odour of Grace or other brake from him; Subjection to Parents or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or Zeal towards God in purging the Temple, or Humility in waſhing his Diſciples feet, or Meekneſs under malicious accuſations and blaſphemies; or melting bowels, upon all occaſions dropping Cures on the bodies, and Heavenly Truths on the Souls of Men; or admirable patience under great ſorrows; and at laſt upon a tormenting Croſs, where he drunk the bitter cup of wrath up to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and over and above all the reſt, ſweet Love and Obedience run through them all, with a pure intention to his Fathers Will and Glory: And Oh! what a Samplar of Grace is here? and how ſtrongly can Faith preſs for an imitation! <q>what? ſhall I not tread in ſuch pure ſteps, my Saviour being before? Of whom ſhall I learn if not of my Redeemer? Did he ſweat and bleed, and die on a Croſs for me, and ſhall I not follow him? Can I reſt on his Merits and precious Obedience, and wave his holy Pattern? Was he to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all Righteouſneſs, and I none at all? If I abide in him, muſt I not walk as he walked? If I know the truth as it is in Jeſus, muſt not thoſe very Graces, which were true in him, be true in me alſo? Why doth the Spirit come and work thoſe Graces in my Heart,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63874:155"/>but that they ſhould be actuated? Unto what was I created in Chriſt, if not to good works? I find nothing but vanity in my ſelf and my own ways, and ſhall I not walk in Chriſt and his holy Graces? If I follow him fully, ſhall I not ſee the Heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan at laſt, and there receive a Crown of Life?</q> Such a Pattern ſo preſſed on a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver muſt needs be a ſtrong motive to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace. The Apoſtle would have us run our race, <hi>looking unto Jeſus,</hi> Heb. 12.1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. Fancy, as Naturaliſts tell us, hath done ſtrange things; a Woman much looking on a beautiful Picture brought forth her Child very like it, as <hi>Galen</hi> relates, to be ſure: Faith looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus brings forth his Image in the Heart and Life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith holds out the Promiſes as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to the work:</hi> The Believer is an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Child of Promiſe; the new Creature with its Graces is born of the Covenant, and ever after lives upon it. Every Grace hath ſome Promiſe or other to feed on. Love hath God dwelling with it; Fear hath his ſecret; Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Salvation; Patience a crop of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and all of them have an entail of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. And when Graces are acted there is a Promiſe of encreaſe, <hi>To him that hath,</hi> that is, uſeth Grace, <hi>more ſhall be given,</hi> more of the ſame Grace; his Talent ſhall be doubled, <hi>his Path ſhineth more and more to the perfect day in Heaven;</hi> and withal more of the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling, Secret, Salvation, and Comfort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:63874:155"/>and at laſt more of Glory. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of divers Graces, ſaith, <hi>That if they be and abound in us, we ſhall have an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant entrance into the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. Every Grace hath an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and abounding Grace an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; and all theſe Promiſes are ſure in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſealed by Gods Veracity, and Chriſts Blood, and ſure to the Believer, being realized by Faith; and therefore muſt needs be very attractive to Obedience. Faith in a meer Command will make a Man follow God, though like <hi>Abraham</hi> he know not whither he go. Much more impulſive is Faith in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, when he knows in ſo following he is going into an abundance of Grace and Glory. The lying Promiſes of Sin received into a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fancy will draw out Corruption into act, as we ſee in Men, who are drawn into Sins car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſpiritual, much as their Father <hi>Adam</hi> was, by ſome Apple of Senſual happineſs, or appearance of Self-excellency; how much more attractive muſt the precious true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God be, when entertained by Faith? at the ſight of theſe the Believer, as old <hi>Jacob,</hi> at the ſight of the Chariots, revives and puts himſelf forth in the exerciſe of Grace, that he may inherit the Promiſes, and the vaſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of good in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith obſerves Seaſons and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and ſtirs up Graces ſuitable thereunto.</hi> Inſidels ſmother the greateſt Works of God; ſome have ſaid, That <hi>Sodom</hi> happened to ſire
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63874:156"/>as ſtanding on a Sulphureous ſoil. Others, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did but take the advantage of a low-tide to carry the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> over the Waſhes. Nay, in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, the Phariſees and Sadducees, though great Rabbies, could not, becauſe without Faith, diſcern the Signs of that glorious time, wherein the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhewed himſelf on Earth in ſuch excellent Doctrines and Miracles. But Faith where it is, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the language of Providence, and calls for ſuitable Graces: under a ſtorm of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it calls for the mourning Graces of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Humiliation, <hi>lamenting after the Lord;</hi> under a Sun of Proſperity it <hi>awakens the Pſaltery and Harp,</hi> Praiſe and holy joy in God the Fountain of all. When Iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, it is for <hi>Davids rivers of tears</hi> to weep over it. When Gods Name or Worſhip, or Truth are at the Stake, it blows up the fire of Zeal; as we ſee in <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Paroxiſm</hi> at <hi>Athens, Epiphanius</hi> his renting the Veil, and <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s ardent adherence to the Truth againſt an <hi>Arrian</hi> World. As the Poor appear, Charity muſt come forth and ſcatter Alms. As Injuries and Reproaches fly abroad, Meekneſs muſt ſhew it ſelf, and rather than revenge, <hi>turn the other cheek.</hi> In Aſſlictions <hi>Patience muſt have her perfect work.</hi> And in Deſertions there muſt be <hi>an humble waiting on him that hides his face.</hi> As God comes forth in this or that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſo Faith meets him in this or that Grace. Every Grace is one time or other called out by a Providence; and every Providence hath ſome Grace to anſwer it.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:63874:156"/>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Faith actuates Graces in a way of dependence on the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> This is <hi>inſtar omnium;</hi> Commands, Patterns, Promiſes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, are ineffectual without it. The New Creature moves not but by influence from the Head; the holy Spirit muſt firſt ſtir up the neſt of gracious Principles, and then Love and Joy, and all other Graces ſhew forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As the Humane Nature of Chriſt never acted in a ſeparate way, but did all in Union with the Divine: So the Believers Graces do nothing apart, but all in Union with Chriſt. Thoſe who think that gracious Powers or Principles may go alone and act themſelves, know not the life of Faith; in which all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hang upon Chriſt as beams upon the Sun. The <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council pronounces an Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema on thoſe that deny the <hi>Adjutorium gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> which worketh to will and to do. And the <hi>Arauſican</hi> ſpeaking of that <hi>Adjutorium.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quoties bona agimus, Deus in nobis atque nobiſcum, ut operemur, operatur.</hi> When <hi>we do good, God works our works in us and with us.</hi> What the life of Faith is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> excellently deſcribes, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. And again, <hi>I labour, yet not I, but the grace of God with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. Faith is ever in dependence, leaning on its Beloved, and breathing after the holy Spirit, that the gales thereof may make the ſpicy Graces flow out; and upon this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Spirit comes down in auxiliary Grace, and there is an effectual working in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63874:157"/>every part of the New Creature; <hi>Love in the Spirit,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.8, and Joy in Spirit, and every other Grace in the Spirit, badding and bloſſoming, and filling the face of the life with holy fruits. Only it muſt be remembred, that this Dependence is in Gods way, where Chriſt is experimentally <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us; to ſtir up all holy Graces into act.</p>
               <p>Thus Faith actuates Graces in a general way common to them all. I now proceed to ſhew how Faith actuates this or that Grace in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And that I may not be too prolix in running over all Graces, I ſhall ſingle ſome choice ones out inſtead of all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall begin with the Grace of <hi>Love.</hi> This is the great Command, the ſum of the Law, a Divine Union with God, a bond of perfection among Men, a holy fire kindled by the Holy Ghoſt in the Heart, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eaſineſs of every good Duty. This Grace whether it reſpect God or Chriſt, or our Neighbour, is actuated by Faith.</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>our Love to God,</hi> it is ſo actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The very light of Nature reveals a God, an excellent perfect Being, or the Being of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whoſe Love, as the Philoſopher ſaid, is the principle and knot of the World, and ſo cannot but raiſe up a kind of Love toward him; the Will being neceſſarily in ſome ſort affected with ſuch an Excellency, though ſeen but by a glimmering light. Not that this Love is a Grace, or a Love in ſincerity, or a Love
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63874:157"/>
                  <hi>ſicut oportet,</hi> as an ancient Council ſpeaks, or indeed in Scripture ſenſe any love at all; becauſe it loves not God above all, it muſt needs be inordinate, there being the ſame ataxy in loving God below the Creature, as in loving the Creature above God; But that there is a kind of Love, ſuch as that dark light can raiſe up in faln man. But when the light of Faith comes, it raiſes up the Grace of Love towards God, and ever after moves it into act by the pure diſcoveries of him, which it lets into the Heart from Scripture. He is (ſaith Faith) an immenſe infinite Goodneſs; Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are but drops of Being lying in the ſhell of Time, but he is the Ocean of all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They may be good for this or that in particular according to their finite kinds and ſpheres, but he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the All-things,</hi> as the Apoſile calls him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. And withal he is <hi>Love it ſelf,</hi> as another Apoſtle hath it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. Not ſhutting up his Allneſs in unapproachable Glory, but letting it out to Believers. His Love, though he ever had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bleſſedneſs in himſelf, would yet pour out it ſelf in making a world of good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and after Mans fall in giving his only Son to take hold of our nature, and in it to bring us back again to himſelf, that he might be our God, and make over his Allneſs to us; and all this in pure Grace, without any Money or Merit on our part, and in rich Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards worms and forlorn Sinners; and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it to us, a Goſpel is let down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63874:158"/>full of great and precious Promiſes; ſuch as are the very counterpanes of that Grace and Mercy which flow in his Heart towards Sinners. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder ſuch muſings of Faith, Oh how the holy fire of Love kindles?</hi> What high rates and eſtimates are ſet upon him? How is the Heart inflamed towards Union, to be one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with him? What Complacencies and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths of reſt doth it find in him? What little things are Worlds and Creatures? What an <hi>All</hi> is He, and an Heaven his Love? What taſtes are there of his Goodneſs and ſurrenders to his Will and Glory? Our Love goes after him, as his is by Faith let in upon the Heart.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Faith excites the Love of him by every act which it ſets about; in its recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bencies it enamours the Heart, that he ſhould give us leave to lean on his Grace, and in ſo doing bear up our weakneſs with Promiſes, and ſweetly anſwer us in Pardons and ſuitable Graces; in its Obedience it is very raviſhing, that he ſhould chalk out ſuch pure ways for us, and take us by the hand and teach us to go, and at laſt crown our faultring Obedience with Eternal Life. Ordinances, which to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief are but dry things, are to Faith the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chariots of the Spirit; Creatures, which are Idols to carnal ſenſe, are to Faith fair mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the infinite Goodneſs and Beauty in the Creator. Which way ſoever Faith turns it ſelf, it meets with ſomething or other inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative of our Love towards him, who is every-where, and <hi>all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:63874:158"/>
               <p>As touching <hi>our Love to Chriſt,</hi> it is actuated in the ſame manner. A meer notion of Chriſt raiſes up ſome Love towards him; as we ſee in thoſe Temporaries, <hi>who receive the word with joy,</hi> Mat. 13.20, which though it be but <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus horarius,</hi> hints out a kind of Love. Such a ſtory as that of <hi>Codrus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> King's dying for his Country could not but affect his Subjects; much more muſt the Hiſtory of Chriſt dying for a World do ſo. Only this Love to Chriſt raiſed up by meer Evangelical notion, as the Love to God raiſed up by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is not right, nor elevated to a Divine pitch, till Faith come and ſhew him forth by a light more congruous than all literal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; and then there is, as the Church after an elegant deſcription concludes, <hi>Totus deſideria, all loves or deſires,</hi> Cant. 5.16. Every thing in him is attractive; What a perſon is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word, <hi>the brightneſs of the Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> What an Union, <hi>Immanuel, God and Man in one?</hi> Heaven and Earth admirably blended together, as a pledg that God would be at one with us? What a robe is his Righteouſneſs made as broad as the Law, and woven all of Love from the top to the bottom? What a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Blood able to expiate a world of Sins, and ſave a world of Sinners? What a treaſure is his Fulneſs, where the Spirit is in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure, and all its Graces in redundance run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over into the veſſels of Faith, and filling all its capacities? Who, that hath eyes of Faith, would not love him? To ask why we ſhould
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63874:159"/>love him, is as the Philoſopher told him who demanded, Why Beauty was ſo taking? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a blind mans queſtion;</hi> nothing but blind unbelief can hold us from his Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Whatever poſture Faith be in, whether contemplating him in the Mount, or leaning on the boſom of his Grace, or hiding in his Wounds, or ſitting at his feet for Wiſdom, or lying under his Scepter for power againſt Sin; ſtill it ſtirs up an holy Love to him. It finds his Blood in every Pardon; his Spirit in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace; his Wine-cellar in every Ordinance; his Seal in every Promiſe; and his Purchaſe in every Creature. No wonder if St. <hi>Paul count all things dung and droſs for him.</hi> And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cry out, <hi>Sero te amavi Domine, Lord, 'twas late e're I loved thee.</hi> True Faith would have none but Chriſt loving him, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>Plus quam mea, meos, me; More than all my goods, my friends, my ſelf:</hi> And as another holy Man did, <hi>weeping that it can love Chriſt no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching <hi>our Love to our Neighbour,</hi> it is alſo actuated by Faith. Reaſon and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity raiſe up a Love towards Man; the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians kindly received St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked Company, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.2. <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> was called <hi>Amor &amp; deliciae humani generis;</hi> the <hi>Love and delight of Mankind:</hi> Suffering none to go away ſad from his Preſence. Nay <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf in a Famine turned all his Plate and rich Houſhold-ſtuff into Money, therewith to fetch Corn out of <hi>Egypt</hi> for the neceſſities of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63874:159"/>the People. Only this Love for want of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural rectitude ſquints at Vain-glory, or moves upon ſome other ſelfiſh Principles; or at beſt riſes up out of a ſimpathy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature. True Love towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſuch as iſſues out of <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5, is <hi>propter Deum,</hi> for <hi>Gods ſake:</hi> And as the School-men ſay, <hi>There is but one root or habit of Love, whereby we love God and our Neighbour, becauſe God as he is ſupream Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the formal reaſon of Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> He only being to be loved for himſelf, and others but the material Objects of Love to be loved for him; hence alſo damned or irrational Creatures are not properly the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Love, becauſe not capable of Union with God in bliſs. Unto this true Love Faith preſſes by ſome ſuch Divine motives as theſe; is not Love a Command? nay, the ſum of the ſecond Table and muſt it not be obeyed? Can we wait for Promiſes, and not obſerve Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? Or may we have the Love of the firſt Table without that of the ſecond? Hath not God loved us in an incomparable unparalleld way, and ſhall we not love our Brother? <hi>Shall infinite bowels open, and finite ones be ſhut?</hi> If any ſhut them, <hi>how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. A touch, a ſenſe of his Love let in by Faith will make ours flow out towards our Neighbour. Such a ſweet preſſure of it was on Mr. <hi>Fox, That he never denied any that asked for Jeſus ſake.</hi> A Believer acting as a Believer cannot be hard
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63874:160"/>to his Neighbour, or ſay, <hi>Go and come again,</hi> as long as the Mercy-ſeat is open: And what is thy Neighbour? is he not thine own fleſh? Nay, doth he not in a ſenſe bear Gods Image; and is he not capable of eternal Bleſſedneſs? And who that hath a hope of ſinging <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> in Heaven would not love ſuch an one? And will not God be glorified thereby? Graces ſhew forth more of God than Creatures, and Love more than all the reſt, becauſe he is Love it ſelf. The Primitive Chriſtians told the World whoſe they were, by their <hi>one heart and one ſoul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Terrull. Apol.</note> Act. 4.32. And afterward their Love was pointed at by the very Pagans, ſaying, <hi>Vide ut invicem ſe diligant, See how they love one another.</hi> And do we know what and how great a thing may be in acts of Love? <hi>Some entertaining ſtrangers have entertained Angels, Heb.</hi> 13.2. But poſſibly we may do more, <hi>we may feed or cloth or viſit Chriſt in his poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and in the other World be repaid all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with uſury. From ſuch Divine Motives as theſe Faith actuates Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but this is not all, Faith actuates it in a regular and congruous way according to relations and propinquities; giving out <hi>a Love of delight to the Saints,</hi> as having moſt of God in them; <hi>a Love of mercy to the poor,</hi> as being Chriſts Treaſurers; <hi>a love of reverence to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> by whom we received our being; <hi>a Love of proviſion to Children,</hi> who are our ſelves mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied; and <hi>a Love of benevolence to all;</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding enemies; <hi>to love enemies,</hi> is, (as one
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63874:160"/>ſaith) <hi>inter mirabilia legis, one of the wonders of the Law;</hi> and yet Faith in the Goſpel-grace will reach it. Hence it is obſervable, that when our Saviour bids his Diſciples <hi>to forgive even ſuch as treſpaſs againſt them ſeven times in a day;</hi> They reply in a Prayer, <hi>Lord, encreaſe our faith, Luk.</hi> 17.5. becauſe Faith will move Love into act even in the difficult duty of forgiving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Another Grace actuated by Faith is <hi>holy Fear of God;</hi> the very light of Nature revealing ſome glimmerings of his Greatneſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice raiſes up a Fear of him: The Barbarians ſeeing the Viper on St. <hi>Pauls</hi> hand cried out of a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>a fearing of God.</hi> The ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to their gods would not touch the conſecrated Gold lying in their Temples. Upon the ſame account there were among many Ethnicks, <hi>Nudipedalia ſacra, barefooted devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Only this Fear was in it ſelf but ſervile, and further corrupted by falſe opinions of the Deity, and hence ſprung all that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>worſhip or ſuperſtition</hi> which was among the Heathens: The progeny of their ancient <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> their Charms and Exorciſms, their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals and Purifications, their Luſtrations and human inhuman Sacrifices, and all their ſtrange Rites and Ceremonies of Adoration, whereby they endeavoured to flatter and compound
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63874:161"/>with their gods, and guilty Conſciences. This ſervile Fear is further advanced when to the light of Nature is ſuperadded that of the pure Law, which flaſhes in upon the Conſcience and ſets it on ſire with reſlections upon guilt, and expectations of wrath thereupon; but it is ſervile ſtill, and chiefly looks at puniſhment. A man in ſuch a ſtate may forbear an act of Sin, but he is corrupt within, <hi>adbue vivit in eo peecandi voluntas,</hi> the <hi>love of Sin is in him ſtill,</hi> as an Ancient hath it; His heart ſaith to his Sin as the Emperour <hi>Baſſimus</hi> did to his beautiful Mother in Law, <hi>Quàm vellem, ſi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret; Oh that there were no Law againſt it, or puniſhment to follow after it:</hi> He may do good, but not well; <hi>Intus reus eſt, &amp; in animo non facit; he is guilty within, and in mind doth it not,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith; there wants that love of righteouſneſs, out of which true Obedience iſſues; but where Faith is, there is <hi>caſtus timor,</hi> a pure filial fear of God, ſuch as reverences his Majeſty as ſupream, and ſears Sin as the greateſt evil; and withal puniſhment in its due place, though not principally or in a ſervile way; and among puniſhments, chiefly that of loſs and ſeparation from God as a greater evil than the reſt. And as Faith ſees the inviſible one more or leſs, ſo this holy Fear is more or leſs moved into act. Of old the appearances of God in outward Symbols of glory ſtruck an a we upon men; <hi>the high Thrones with its train</hi> made <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cry out as an <hi>undone man, Iſa.</hi> 6. the voice out of the whirl-wind cauſed <hi>Job to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63874:161"/>himſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42.6. The bright thining man turned <hi>Daniel's comelineſs into corruption,</hi> Dan. 10.8. And what thoſe outward appearances did in a ſenſible way, that Faith which is an inward Viſion of God, doth in a Spiritual; looking on him by Faith, a dread falls on us from every Attribute or Work of his. His glorious Majeſty makes us go and hide our ſelves in the duſt of our own vileneſs and nothingneſs. His pure Holineſs comparatively turns us and all our comely Graces into rottenneſs. His dreadful Juſtice ſounds ſo loud in the threatning, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tremble at every word of it. Nay his very goodneſs and tender bowels lying all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us make us afraid to trample thereon by finning; even thoſe in Nature do ſo, much more thoſe richer ones in Grace. <hi>His very rain calls for out fear,</hi> Jer. 5.24. And what do thoſe dews of the Spirit which are not common as the other? His bounding the Sea doth ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. and what doth his bounding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which elſe would drown Soul and all in perdition? Oh how tremendous is our life! our Bodies living on the Blood of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and our Souls on the Blood of God; our natural being lying in the arms of that Power which bears up the World, and our Spiritual in the arms of that Grace which ſaves it; Earth flowing round about us with Bleſſings, and Heaven it ſelf coming down in Promiſes, and carrying back our Hopes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who in ſuch Viſions of Faith would not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63874:162"/>
                  <hi>fear the Lord and his goodneſs?</hi> Who would not tremble at Sins indignity and ingratitude? After ſuch mercies as theſe <hi>ſhould we again tranſgreſs againſt him?</hi> If we wax wanton un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Goodneſs, how ſoon may Soveraignty come down and recover all from us as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited! Heaven may ſhut up it ſelf, and the dews of the Spirit ceaſe, our Graces may all droop and wither, and our Hearts grow hard and ſtony; one luſt or other may carry us into captivity, and our little remnant of Grace and Life may cry out as the Church doth, <hi>O Lord why haſt thou made us to err from thy ways? and hardned our hearts from thy fear? return for thy ſervants ſake,</hi> Iſa. 63.17. After all our wantonneſs we ſhall be glad to come to holy Fear again; Soveraignty will make us fear him in every thing: ſuch a fight of him by Faith as this makes him practically to us <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the fear,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. Moreover Faith moves this Fear into act by ſhewing the great evil of Sin: Senſe looks on penal evils which preſs on the outward man, but Faith on Sin as the greateſt of evils, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an oppoſite to God, a blot to the Soul, a blaſt to the World, a forfeiture of Heaven, and fuel for the flames of Hell; a thing not to be done, <hi>Pro quantiſcunque bonis lucrandis, aut pro quantiſcunque malis pracavendis;</hi> for <hi>the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſo great a good, or for the avoiding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great an evil,</hi> as <hi>Bradwardine</hi> ſpeaks. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>That a man muſt not tell a lie to ſave a world.</hi> And <hi>Henry Flander</hi> being a
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63874:162"/>Priſoner for the Proteſtant Religion, would not ſay, That his Wife was his Whore, no, not to ſave his life offered to him on thoſe terms. Now Fear being a kind of flight from evil, the greater the evil is, the greater is the flight; and when an evil is the greateſt of evils, ſuch as Sin appears to Faith, the flight from it is as from Hell it ſelf; and more if poſſible, according to the ſaying of <hi>Anſelm, That if Sin were ſet before him on the one band, and Hell on the other, he would rather leap into Hell than fall into Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Grace actuated by Faith, is <hi>Zeal,</hi> which is an intenſe Love, or a mixture of Love and Anger, or rather the heat and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up of all the affections in the concerns of God and his Glory: This is <hi>a coal from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> which warms Hearts and Lives, and ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles out in every Grace and Duty; without it all is <hi>in ſpirituali gelicidio,</hi> cold and frozen, as in a Sunleſs World. Indeed without Faith Zeal is blind, as in the <hi>Jew,</hi> who in his heat for the Law oppoſes the Goſpel and true Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; Or it runs out upon Humane things as in the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who crys up Traditions as a ſecond Oracle; or it moves upon ſelfiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who did all thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically <hi>to be ſeen of men.</hi> But when Faith comes, Zeal is according to the Word as its Rule, and for Divine things as the worthieſt Object; and out of a pure intention to Gods Glory as the ſupream end. Faith brings us into Communion with God, and makes us <hi>one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63874:163"/>with him;</hi> and hence it comes to paſs, that thoſe things which are dear to him are ſo to us; and thoſe injuries which move his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie above, ſtir up our Zeal here below. To Faith Gods name is <hi>nomen Majeſtativum, holy, reverend,</hi> fearful, glorious, precious, <hi>a name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every name,</hi> and therefore cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned; but Zeal will break forth, the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches caſt on it fall more heavily on the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver than thoſe on himſelf or his near relations; Nay they preſs harder on him, than if he ſhould hear one railing at Princes or Angels. <hi>Maris</hi> the blind Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> being brought into the preſence of the blaſphemous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Julian,</hi> fell ſeverely on him as upon an enemy of God; and when <hi>Julian</hi> told him, That he was blind, and his <hi>Galilean</hi> God would not cure him: <hi>Maris gave thanks to God, who had taken away his eyes, that he might not look on ſo wicked a wretch as Julian.</hi> Such a Zeal doth Faith put forth for Gods name. In like manner the Worſhip of God is to Faith, his Homage, honour on Earth, Crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Sanctuary of Preſence, a thing too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pure to be allayed with Humane mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; if this be corrupted, our Zeal muſt needs kindle at it, and ſo much the more, becauſe his facred jealouſie hangs more over his Worſhip than over any thing elſe in all the World. To the other Commandments we find this annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> Lev. 19; but to the ſecond, <hi>I am a jealeus God,</hi> Exod. 20.5. Hence <hi>Moſes</hi> at the light of the Calf forgets his Meekneſs,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63874:163"/>and in a holy Paſſion brake the holy Tables. In the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Council held about the year of our Lord 754, how hot were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops againſt Images as a meer Pagan cuſtom! and when they were caſt down, how trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant was the Peoples Zeal crying out, <hi>Hodiè ſalus mundo,</hi> now <hi>is ſalvation come to the world!</hi> In <hi>the fifth Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> they would have the very reliques of Idolatry totally blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. Nay, <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the <hi>Manichees</hi> Worſhipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> forbade the Chriſtians to worſhip towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> that they might have nothing common with them. Such a Zeal doth Faith ſtir up for the Worſhip of God, and no leſs for the Truth of God: this is a precious jewel, a ſecret out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boſom, a beam come down from Heaven to light us thither; if this be ſubverted, Zeal will ſtand up and vindicate it. <hi>Secundus</hi> when he was commanded to deliver up his Bibles to be burnt, anſwered, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum &amp; non traditor.</hi> In the firſt General Councils how earneſt were the Fathers for the Faith? they would not exchange a letter or ſyllable of it: The <hi>Arrian</hi>

Such a Zeal for truth doth Faith ralſe up. In ſum Faith hath a ſingle eye
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63874:164"/>at Gods Glory; and ſo endears all things ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto, that upon the leaſt violation thereof Zeal will be ready to break forth in that behalf. Moreover, Faith gives a further advance thereunto by looking on the unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled Love of God. O what a Zeal hath he for our Salvation! Hath he not writ our poor names in the book of Life, and ſhall we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his glorious one? Hath not he ſent his own Son in the fleſh to be the great Ordinance of our Salvation, and to fill all the under-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances with his Spirit and Grace, and ſhall we not be zealous in and for his Worſhip? Are not his holy Truths <hi>the day-ſtar in our bearts,</hi> ſeeds of the New Creature, and Cordials of rich Comfort, and ſhall we not earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for them? Will he not glorifie us to all eternity above, and ſhall we not glorifie him in our little ſpan of time here below? Whileſt Faith is thus muſing, the fire of Zeal muſt needs kindle in our Hearts.</p>
               <p>Another Grace actuated by Faith is <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> which is as cool in our own cauſe as Zeal is hot in Gods. This is the great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratrix of Anger, that it breaks not out <hi>Preter squum &amp; bonum,</hi> not unjuſtly for a light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; as that Pope's did, who raged upon the miſſing a cold Peacock; and blaſphemouſly added <hi>If God was ſo angry for an Apple, he might juſtly be ſo for a Peacock:</hi> Nor upon a juſt cauſe exceſſively; as it did in that great Conqueror <hi>Stephen King of Poland,</hi> who was ſo angry with the <hi>Rigenſes</hi> about the <hi>Gregorian Calendar.</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:63874:164"/>that he ſell into Epileptical ſus and died. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Meekneſs is a beautiful thing, and ſo is Moral, but neither is a Grace: Natural being but the reſult of a ſweet temper of Body, and Moral but the improvement of Reaſon; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther levels ſo high as Gods Glory. In Natural we do but comply with our Temperament, and in Moral but ſacrifice to our Reaſon: But the Grace of Meekneſs is a portion of that Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Spirit which reſted upon Chriſt, and aims at his Glory whoſe Goodneſs is reſembled thereby. Hence it is obſervable, that where the Meekneſs is only Natural or Moral, Men will be angerleſs and ſintully meek even when Gods Glory lies at the Stake, their Meekneſs being as oppoſite to holy Zeal, as to raſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but where the Grace of Meekneſs is, Men in their own concerns glorifie God by a cool converſe, and in Gods call for Zeal to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Glory. To promote this Grace Faith doth many things; as <hi>firſt,</hi> it looks at the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Long-ſufferance of God; O what doth he bear from Men! His Laws are violated, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings abuſed, Name blaſphemed, Glory ſtained, and all by his own Creatures, and in his own World, and day after day, year after year, nay, one age after another, and yet the axle-tree of his Patience breaks not under it;<note place="margin">

Here all men, and all in men, even the Princely powers of Reaſon and Will, with all the progeny of Thoughts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt bow down before God: A famous inſtance of which we have in the Noble <hi>Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who being queſtioned for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant by his Soveraign <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, bravely profeſſed, <hi>That his Body, Eſtate, and Dignity was in his Majeſty's power, but his Soul was only ſubject to God.</hi> From ſuch a Supream Authority in the Command Faith preſſes ſtrongly to Obedience; and for a ſweet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple thereunto, it draws a free Spirit from Chriſt. Faith tranſlates us into the Kingdom of Chriſt, and there by a ſingular Priviledg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Kingdom, all the Subjects are ready to do the Commands of their Lord. Faith converſes much about the Wounds and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sacrifice of Chriſt, and there the free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwells, as the free bird in the Altar, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.3. And being received by Faith, brings forth a numerous off-ſpring in acts of Obedience. Faith makes us parts and pieces of Chriſt, and ſo we are anointed with the Holy Ghoſt in ſome meaſure; as his Humane Nature was in a tranſcendent way. Faith dwells in the holy Truth, and that makes us free indeed. Whileſt Precepts give the Rule, Promiſes afford the Power; ſuch a Promiſe as that, <hi>I will cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> Ezek. 36.27. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixed with Faith will impower us to all Obedience. Hence the Service of God becomes a freedom, and Obedience eaſie and natural
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63874:167"/>moving upon the wheels of Love, and wings of the Spirit, which muſt needs be a very ſtrong incentive to Obedience; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe Faith enſures the acceptance thereof. Were we to obey under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, which will bate nothing of pure ſinleſs Perfection, our Obedience might be bootleſs and heartleſs; becauſe every act of it would vaniſh and come to nothing by the adherent Corruption; which made <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay, <hi>That if a man did cull out the moſt excellent work of all his life, he would find ſome corrupt fleſh or other in it.</hi> And St. <hi>Auſtin, Vae vite landabili, Wo to a laudable life without mercy:</hi> But we are to obey under the Covenant of Grace, whence Sincerity is accepted, and frailty covered. God gives a Toſtimonial of Righteouſneſs to <hi>Noah,</hi> not withſtanding his Infirmities; and of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs to <hi>Aſa,</hi> notwithſtanding the high Places. Uprightneſs paſſes for abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the main of the Heart for all of it; inſomuch that it is ſaid of <hi>Joſiah, That he turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes,</hi> 2 King. 23.25. his Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was taken as if all had been fulfilled;<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 1. c. 19.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of St. <hi>Auſtin, Omnia mandata facta deputantur, quando quicquid non ſit ignoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur.</hi> There are Pardons ready ſealed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Believers Inſirmities; God forgives what is ours in a duty, and accepts what is his own. Our Duties are taken into the hand of Chriſt the Mediator, and there perfumed with
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63874:167"/>his ſweet Merits; and though as they are in our hands they have droſs and ſoil in them, yet as they are in his they are glorified Duties, and as ſweet Odours to God. And upon ſuch terms as theſe who would not obey? Every act of Obedience ſhall be accepted; and the light of Gods Countenance will irradiate our Duties. And to give a further advance to this Grace, Faith looks within the Veil to the great recompence in Heaven; there are Crowns of Life, rivers of Pleaſures, and plenitudes of Joy for ever; there holy Souls ſee all Truths in their Original, drink all Good out of the Fountain, and have God for their All in All; and all this is the reward of our poor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience. And as ſuch is outwardly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the Promiſes, and inwardly realized by Faith, and therefore muſt needs move the Believer ſtrongly to Obedience; no wonder if he burn in Devotions, or melt in Charity, or labour in other acts of Obedience, all theſe being but a <hi>ſowing to the Spirit,</hi> will come up in a crop of Eternal Life; his Prayers will be turned into <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> his Alms repaid in Everlaſting Love, and all his good Works, which follow him into another World, ſhall be woven into a Crown of Immortality. And upon ſuch an account who would not obey and live in perpetual reſignation; as he did, who (as the ſtory goes) always concluded his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thus, <hi>Domine, quid me vis facere; Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And <hi>lived in ſuch holy joys, as if he had been in Heaven already?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:63874:168"/>
               <p>Another Grace actuated by Faith, is <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> This is Meekneſs towards God, as Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is Patience towards Man, and reſpecteth Gods Diſpoſing Will as Obedience doth his Commanding: This is a Subjection to God, a Poſſeſſion of our Selves, and an Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Others. Hence the Conſtancy of <hi>Annas Burgus</hi> a Senator of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſuffering for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe, made many curious to know what Religion that was for which he ſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endured death. To promote this Grace, Faith in the firſt place looks up to God as ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the ſtern and ruling all; every Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a piece of his Government; to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt it is rebellion: in ſuch a caſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becomes us ſo much as with <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>hold our peace;</hi> or if we open our lips to do it with <hi>Job, Bleſſing the name of the great Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Taker.</hi> Is he not the Lord, and may he not do as he will in his own World, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his own Creatures? Should not all fleſh be ſilent before him? None but himſelf may or can be Rector of the World, and yet in every act of Impatience we aſpire and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually would be ſuch our ſelves: and is he not Inſinitely wiſe and juſt in all that he doth? Every Wheel hath an eye in it, and every Croſs its juſt proportion, and to think that it might have been better is to blaſpheme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. This made that holy Man Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> in his Sickneſs after extream ſits of pain ſay to his Servant, <hi>O think well of God for it, for it is moſt juſtly and wiſely done whatſoever he doth.</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:63874:168"/>And is he not gracious and merciſul, and doth not Mercy rejoyce againſt Judgment? <hi>The meaſire of Grace</hi> (as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins ſay) <hi>is ever larger than the meaſure of Judgment, for one Croſs we have many Bleſſings.</hi> And ſhall we receive good, much good at his hand, and not a little evil? If we have his Heavenly Graces, how much may we bate of Earth and its Comforts? If Sin, the greateſt burden of all be taken off in a Pardon, may we not eaſily bear the leſſer ones? Thus Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> told his Son in Law, complaining of his Croſſes, <hi>When Affliction lyeth heavy, Sin lyeth light:</hi> If guilt preſs not, any thing may be born, nay, is not he gracious and merciful in the very Affliction? Doth he not ſupport with one hand, whileſt he ſmites with another? St. <hi>Paul</hi> glories in his Infirmites, <hi>That the power of Chriſt may reſt upon him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. And the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Potamenia</hi> being threatned to be caſt into a Veſſel of burning Pitch, begged,<note place="margin">Spond. Annal. Ann. 310.</note> 
                  <hi>That ſhe might not be caſt in all at once, but piece-meal, that they might ſee how much Patience the unknown Chriſt had given unto her;</hi> and <hi>doth he not make all work together for good?</hi> What are the iſſues of Affliction to Believers, but the purgation of Sins, trials of Grace, peaceable fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and inward joys and experiences of Gods Goodneſs? Let Faith but caſt up the reckoning, and it will appear, That he afflict us in Love and Faithfulneſs, and therefore it muſt needs be well taken; the wounds of ſuch a Friend being better than the kiſſes of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63874:169"/>the enemy-World. Again, to advance this Grace, Faith makes a right judgment of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; to Senſe theſe are grievous, but to Faith fit and congruous. The World in which the Believer lives, is a ſtage of Sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to be a place of ſorrow; how calm ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was before Sin entred, it is now a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea, an Ocean of Evils, as <hi>Antoninus</hi> calls an Empire: Storms and toſſing waves are proper in it, and to be expected by every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger; as much a Paradiſe as it was before, it is now a Wilderneſs, thorns and thiſtles of trouble grow naturally in it, and give many a ſcratch and ſting to the poor Pilgrim in his way to Heaven. The Believer himſelf as a Man is <hi>born to trouble,</hi> and <hi>altogether vanity, all-Adam is all-Abel, or vanity,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. He comes into the World weeping, and very fitly, becauſe by his Sin he hath ſet the whole Creation a groaning until now: and as a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever he lives <hi>as a lilly among thorns,</hi> ſo is his perſon in the World among wicked ones, which are as pricking briars on every ſide, and ſo is the Grace in his heart among the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Corruption, which are as thorns in the fleſh: And whileſt Sin is within, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grnous that trouble ſhould be without; nay, more than congrnous, it is neceſſary upon many accounts. Affliction is purgative of Sin; it may be the Believers Heart may wax proud, and the tumor muſt be lanced, or light, and the vanity muſt be fanned away; it may be hard, and the furnace muſt melt it; or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63874:169"/>and the rod muſt awaken it. One ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or other is ready to grow upon us; and <hi>O felices tribulos tribulationum! Oh happy thorns of Affliction, which let them out!</hi> It Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine be neceſſary, ſo is Affliction, which is Spiritual Phyſick for our peceant Humours. Affliction is the way which Chriſt hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by going in it himſelf to the Throne of Glory; and Believers muſt follow him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goes. Innocency it ſelf ſuffering, lumps of duſt and ſin cannot but do ſo. He drinking up the full cup of Wrath, well may we take a few drops of it; eſpecially ſeeing our ſufferings are ſweetned by his; and his Heaven will be ours at laſt, where <hi>the light mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany ſufferings</hi> ſhall be remunerated with <hi>an eternal weight of hyperbolical Glory. Luther</hi> ſaith of himſelf, That looking on the Suſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, he counted his own as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And St. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes Chriſt, <hi>Et ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Patiendi &amp; pretium Patientis, both a glaſs of Patience, and a reward of the Patient.</hi> Now we are toſſing and toyling at Sea, but the port of Bliſs is within ken, and anon we ſhall be there: In the interim we may taſie Heaven in the Joys of the holy Spirit, which ſheds abroad the Love of God in our Hearts, and ſo gives us <hi>Praemium ante praemium,</hi> a leſſer Heaven before a greater. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Not to name any more Particulars, I ſhall conclude this Point touching the actuating of Graces with one Obſervation more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith connects all Graces together as links in a Chain, and ſo by actuating one advances all in ſome meaſure.</hi> The School-men do many of them allow a Connexion of all Moral Virtues in Prudence, and yet commonly affirm, That Faith may be without Charity: As if Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Graces were not ſo well united as Moral Virtues. But the truth is, true Faith is never without Charity; true Faith makes <hi>us ſons of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12. but without Charity we are ſpurious and Children of the Devil. By true Faith <hi>Chriſt dwells in the heart,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. and where he dwells, Charity cannot be abſent; true Faith <hi>puriſies the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. and without Charity there can be no Purity. True Faith reſts on the meer Grace of God in Chriſt, and that muſt needs in flame the Heart towards him, <hi>Tamum amamus quantum credimus.</hi> Hence <hi>Aquinas</hi> himſelf confeſſes, <hi>That though Faith and Hope may be without Charity, yet without Charity they are not properly Virtues.</hi> And <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Credere in Deum non eſt praeciſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63874:170"/>actus fidei, ſid actus fidei &amp; charitatis ſimul; To believe in God is not preciſely an act of Faith, but of Faith and Charity together.</hi> So Inſeparable are theſe two Graces. But leaving the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I ſhall proceed. Faith connects all Graces together in a triple way; it connects them in the fontal cauſe, <hi>the boly Spirit,</hi> which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; all Graces are from the Spirit, and the Spirit is received by Faith; hence <hi>rivers of living water flow in the Believers heart,</hi> Joh. 7.38. that is, All Graces flow there as waters from a fountain; it connects them in the Rule, <hi>the Command of God,</hi> which it univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. It is obſerved by Divines, That the five laſt Commands in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. run thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, and thou ſhalt not commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thou ſhalt not Steal, and thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs, and thou ſhalt not Govet.</hi> The word, <hi>And,</hi> points out to us, that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are coupled together by God, like the Curtains of the Tabernacle; all are as it were one body, and Faith hath a reſpect to every one of them, and in every one owns the ſame ſtamp of Divine Authority. He that ſaid, Love thy God, ſaid alſo, Love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: He that ſaid, Be Zealous, ſaid alſo, Be Meek, and Patient, and Obedient, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in all Grace. It connects them alſo in the end, <hi>the Glory of God,</hi> which it looks at in all things; all Graces tend to that Glory, and Faith is the ſingle eye which guides them all thither. <hi>Bonum opus intentio facit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Enarr. in Pſal. 31. in Praſ.</note> 
                  <hi>intentionem ſides dirigis,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> Faith knows
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63874:171"/>what that is wherein God would be gloriſied. All Graces being thus connected in Faith, which is a kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>firmament,</hi> (as the word is <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5.) to them all; it comes to paſs, that Faith in actuating any one Grace, gives a ſtrength and further growth to every other Grace. Thus it is in Graces reſpecting diſtinct Tables, the more we act our Love to God, the more will be our Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: this, though belonging to the ſecond Table, flows <hi>ex fonte pietatis,</hi> out of that fountain of Piety, which reſpects the firſt. Thus it is in thoſe Graces which are ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as in Zeal and Meekneſs; the more we act our Zeal for God, the more will be our Meekneſs towards Men. Hence in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, who were ſo hot for Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, was found a very meek Spirit; and the reaſon is, becauſe a Man cannot truly actuate one Grace, but he will have more of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is fontally all Grace; and graciouſly multiplies Talents in the uſe of them: Neither can he truly obey one Command, but it will render his Heart more Obediential and ready to obey others alſo, as being enjoined by the ſame Authority: nor can he in one thing look at Gods Glory, but it will in ſome meaſure encline him to ſeek it in other things alſo; and ſo the New Creature grows in every part, and his Path ſhines more and more to the perfect day in Heaven.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAVing treated of Juſtification, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sanctification, which are Fruits of Faith, and are more or leſs in all Believers; I now proceed to ſome other, which are <hi>The Crowns and Statures of Faith,</hi> and to be found not in all Believers, at leaſt not at firſt; but in ſuch as have made a good progreſs in Grace. Faith, have made a good progreſs in Grace. Faith, having obtained the Holy Spirit with all its Graces, doth now go on like <hi>The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Eunuch,</hi> rejoycing in the ways of God, glorying in Free Grace, triumphing in Jeſus Chriſt, warring againſt Corruptions, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Holy Graces, bowing down under the Commands of Heaven, ſucking the Sweet-Breaſts of the Promiſes, and waiting for the Heavenly Dews and Diſtillations of the Spirit; and in this holy Progreſs gathers up many
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63874:172"/>choice Experiments more worth than a World. All learned Men are for Experiments, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would cry, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I have found it:</hi> the Sages of the Law are for tried Caſes, which have been <hi>ſub judice;</hi> the Phyſitian ſets a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum eſt</hi> on approved Medicines; the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts hunts after the <hi>arcana</hi> of Nature by Diſſection of Bodies, and the Chymiſt by Diſſolution thereof. Experience is <hi>procreatrix Artium,</hi> the very Parent of Arts, whoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Precepts are collected by an induction of particulars; but there are no Experiments like thoſe of Faith. Dr. <hi>Dees</hi> Spirits made as if they would reveal great Myſteries to him, ſuch as they called the <hi>Cabbala</hi> of Nature, the Numbers of the World, the <hi>linea Spiritus Sancti,</hi> the <hi>Mirabilia Dei,</hi> and the <hi>Nova terra</hi> bringing forth without Tillage, but all theſe were but Dreams and Impoſtures; and ſo I ſuppoſe are many things in Chymiſtry, like <hi>Helmonts Alkaheſt,</hi> wonderful, if true: But the Experiments of Faith are great Realities, and withal Divine, as much above thoſe in the Sphear of Nature as Souls are above Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Heaven is above Earth. God in the Prophet calls on his People to baing in the Tythes for his Houſe, and ſo by their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to prove him, <hi>If he would not open the windows of Heaven, and pour out a bleſſing, that there ſhould not be room enough to receive it, Mal.</hi> 3.10. When Faith goes on in a Tract of Obedience proving of God, Heaven opens in wonderful Experiences of him, the <hi>Manna</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:63874:172"/>of holy Truth is then taſted, the Hony-combs of Free-Grace drop upon the Heart, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are realized &amp; exemplified in Providences; Divine Helps and Salvations come down and call for <hi>Eben-Ezers</hi> to be ſet up for them; and Diſcoveries of heavenly things in their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and excellency are in a manner made, as if a Man could look into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſee God Face to Face. Some ſuch Experiences I ſuppoſe the learned <hi>Rivet</hi> had in his laſt Sickneſs, in which he ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>In theſe ten days I have made a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Divinity, than in all my Life;</hi> but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Generals I ſhall come to Particulars.</p>
               <p>One great Experiment of Faith is <hi>touching the Truths of God,</hi> a Believer in his holy Progreſs comes <gap reason="foreign">

Here I ſhall Inſtance in that one Fundamental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Truth, which is pregnant with all other, <hi>viz.</hi> that the holy Scriptures are the very Word of God, and ſo to be embraced by all Chriſtians: The Papiſts ſay, That the Authority of the Scriptures depends, at leaſt <hi>quoad nos,</hi> on the Definition of the Church, and that upon that account chiefly it is to be beloved by us. By the Church they mean the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63874:173"/>Church of Paſtors, and thoſe gathered in a Council to deſine the Canon of Scripture. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a Church which is <hi>The Pillar and Ground of the Truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. But, as our learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> hath obſerved, That is not the Church of Paſtors but of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and in truth the Word of Life is more purely held forth in the Lives and Experiences of Believers, than in the Gifts of Paſtors. This <hi>Theſis</hi> ſome of their Grandees have proſecuted even to Blaſphemy, ſaying, That without the Judgment of the Church they would give no more credit to <hi>Matthew</hi> than to <hi>Livy,</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Scriptures much as they do <hi>Eſops Fables.</hi> That this Opinion is falſe is as clear as the Light: true Faith is a pure infuſion, which hangs on the irradiating Spirit as a Beam on the Sun, and in Scripture ſees, with the <hi>creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> the reaſon of believing in the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſtamped thercon.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:63874:174"/>Heart. The Church may bear witneſs to the Scripture, but it can add no Authority to it. If the Church hath Authority to define the Canon, it muſt have it from Scripture, and then the Scripture muſt have Authority even <hi>quoad nos</hi> before that Definition; unleſs they will abſurdly diſtinguiſh and ſay, That the Scripture-Authority before the Definition, is only as to Paſtors, and not as to Believers till after it. All the Churches Authority is from Scripture, and How can the derivative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority add to the Primitive? The Scripture is <hi>Principium ſcientificum,</hi> and therefore to be received by its light without a <hi>quare,</hi> or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it is ſo; the Scripture is a Foundation to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. and ſuch a one that the Church is no further a Church than as it is built thereon; and How can the Church be a Foundation to the Scripture? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a Law to the Church, every Soul muſt be under it; and How can the Subject-Church give Authority to the Law which it Self is under? The Judgment of the Church hath been variable: in the <hi>Council of Carthage</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it was Decreed that thoſe, which were baptized by Hereticks returning to the Church, ſhould be rebaptized, the one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſin being only in the Church, and none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Eccleſia non eſt, Baptiſma non eſt.</hi> Afterwards, the firſt Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Firſt, not as if it had been firſt in time, but as omitting the firſt <hi>Cyprianical</hi> Council as antiquated) enacted that Baptiſm made in
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63874:174"/>the name of the Sacred Trinity ſhould not be reiterated, all crying out, <hi>Abſit,</hi> againſt reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the ſeventh General Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> the 338 Biſhops cried down Images might and main, <hi>Quomodo Dei matrem, quam obumbravit plenitudo Deitatis, vulgaris Gentilium ars pingere audet? non fas eſt Chriſtianis, qui ſpem Reſurrectionis babent, demonum culturae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudinibus uti; flagitium eſt, as Gregorius Theologus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Fidem habere in coloribus non in corde. Quis gloriam &amp; ſplendorem Chriſti effigiare poſſet mortuis coloriius?</hi> ſaid <hi>Euſebius Pamphili,</hi> in his Letter to the Empreſs <hi>Conſtantia.</hi> One would have thought that the broken Images would never have been ſet together again; but within leſs than half a Century comes the <hi>ſecond Council of Nice,</hi> and there the 350 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops bring in Images again under the wings of the <hi>old Cherubims,</hi> and ſet them up upon <hi>Jacobs Pillar,</hi> and back them with Fathers and Miracles. They throw out <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt the <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> and reject with a Curſe the Books of <hi>Euſebius</hi> as a Man delivered over <hi>in reprobum ſenſum.</hi> And are well perſwaded that Angels are Corporeal, and may be pictured. A little after, and within the ſame half-Century comes the Council of <hi>Francford</hi> halting between both the former, ſpeaking half in the Language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and half in the pure Language, allowing Images, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any Worſhip to them. And as touching the Canon, it will afterwards appear, how the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> differs about that from
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63874:175"/>the third Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and how the fixth Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in confirming them both varies from it ſelf. The Judgment of the Church hath been ſubject to Error; the famous Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had two lapſes in it: in the <hi>twelfth Canon</hi> it forbids Chriſtians, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to return to their Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and in the Ninteenth, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Rebaptization of ſuch as were Baptized by Hereticks. The Emperour <hi>Zeno</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, the Tyrant <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> by the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Timotheus Aelurus</hi> wrote Letter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the General Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> unto which as impious as they were, no leſs than five hundred Biſhops ſubſcribed at the Tyrants Command. And touching the Canon, if the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> be right in it, that of <hi>Carthage</hi> is not ſo; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which takes in both, muſt needs be in an Error. Theſe things premiſed; Can the unvariable and infallible Scripture hang upon a variable and errable Authority ſuch as Mans is? May all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes of Life and Salvation be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and pendent on an Humane <hi>Arbitrium? Tertullian</hi> in his Apology ſpeaking of that old Decree among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that no God ſhould be conſecrated without the approbation of the Senate, ſaith, <hi>Apud nos de humano arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratu divinitas penſitatur, niſi homini Deus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuerit, Deus non erit.</hi> If the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depend on the Church, then we may ſay, <hi>Niſi homini Scriptura placuerit, Scriptura non
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63874:175"/>erit;</hi> and by conſequence all the Faith of the Saints muſt be pendulous and hanging on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. If the Churches deſinition be ſo momentous to Scripture, let us ſee what the Church hath done in it; Hath it collected the Canonical Books into a body? 'Tis probable <hi>Ezra</hi> collected the Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a body, and ſo think many of the ancient Fathers. And I ſuppoſe St. <hi>John</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Books of the New Teſtament toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he lived after all the other Apoſtles, even unto the time of <hi>Trajan;</hi> that by his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy the Canon of the New Teſtament might be kept pure and unadulterate. When after St. <hi>Pauls</hi> death there was a Book called, <hi>Periodus Pauls &amp; Teclae,</hi> ſpread abroad under the Name and Title of <hi>Paul;</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to be ſpurious, inſomuch that the Author of it confeſſed that he did it <hi>amore Pauli.</hi> And I believe what was done in this collection of the Canon was not done by an ordinary Spirit, but by a Prophetical Spirit in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and an Apoſtolical one in St. <hi>John.</hi> In the mean time it appears not to have been done by an act of the Church: but leaving this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, When and how did the Church define the Canon? Such a momentous thing ſhould have been done by the Primo-primitive Church, in the firſt Century, whileſt the Church of Chriſt was a <hi>pure Virgin,</hi> as <hi>Egeſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> ſaid.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Diſt. 21. Queſt. 1.</note> Thus the School-man <hi>Durandus</hi> lays it down, <hi>Hoc quod dictum eſt de approbatione Scripturae per Eccleſiam, intelligitur ſolum de
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63874:176"/>Eccleſiâ, que fuit tempore Apoſtolorum, qui ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt repleti Spiritu ſancto:</hi> No Church ſo fit to do it as that which had ſo much of the holy Spirit; but nothing was done in it in that Age. The ſo called <hi>Canons of the Apoſtles</hi> (which in the 85th. Canon take in three Books of <hi>Macchabees</hi> into the old Canon, and the Conſtitutions and Epiſtles of <hi>Clement</hi> into the new,) are clearly adulterate; theſe condemn ſecond Marriages, deprive not a Clergy-man of communion for Fornication or Perjury, or Theſt, and ſpeak of <hi>Altars, Oblations, Veſſels, of Gold and Silver ſanctified, Cantors and Lectors,</hi> and many other ſuch-like altogether unknown in thoſe Apoſtolical times. About theſe Canons <hi>Mirè inter ſe digladiantur Pontiſicii,</hi> ſaith one. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in a <hi>Roman</hi> Synod of ſeventy Biſhops, declares them <hi>Apocryphal, in toto; Bellarmine</hi> rejects all but the firſt fifty, and I think all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> caſt away the 85th. Canon touching the Scripture as Suppoſititious. The firſt Virgin-Century doing nothing in this grand matter; one might have lookt for it in the ſecond or third; but there is no foot-ſtep of it. In the fourth Century about the year 320 came the famous Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and then it might have been expected, as the apteſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their Orthodox Concluſions againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> and withal for a ſtated Rule againſt all future Hereſies; but there is a failure alſo, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done in it. And into what Heart can it enter, that in all thoſe 320 years there was no Canon, no Authority of Scripture, no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63874:176"/>for the Primitive Chriſtians to fix their Faith upon? In thoſe days Paganiſm was ſtrong, and Perſecutions hot, and Divine Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials neceſſary; and yet the Scripture for want of the Churches Definition, was not of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to the Chriſtians then living; I ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Popiſh Theſis it was not. But to go on: Afterwards about the year of our Lord 368 came the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which in the 59th. Canon orders, That no Books ſhould be read in the Church but the Canonical ones of the Old and New Teſtament; and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates as Canonical ſuch as are received in the Reformed Church, only omitting the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe:</hi> And now had not that Omiſſion been, and had this Council been a General one, the work had been done. But afterwards in this very Century about the year 398, the third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> in its 47th. Canon reckons up as Canonical, <hi>Tobit, Judith, two Books of Macchabees,</hi> and <hi>five Books of Solomon,</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtious</hi> to be two of them. In this Council St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was preſent, who yet in his Book <hi>de Civitate Dei, Lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 20, ſaith, That <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> in the judgment of the more learned were not <hi>Solomens,</hi> and were chiefly received in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church; it ſeems the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> received them not. In the end of the next Century a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 494. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſeventy Biſhops enumerates the ſame Books as Canonical which are reckoned ſo in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſave only that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63874:177"/>the Book of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and names but one of the <hi>Macchabees.</hi> Theſe particular Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Councils being of incompetent Authority to deſine the Canon for the Univerſal Church, and withal variant, nay repugnant among themſelves. Whither muſt we go but to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council? but Oh how late very late doth that come? How long will the Authority of Scripture and Faith of Chriſtians be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? and to how little ſatisfaction will this deſinition be? About the year 682 was the ſixth General Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Trullo,</hi> and as to this Point, what did it? It conſirmed the <hi>Canons of the Apoſtles, the Council of Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> and the <hi>Council of Carthage;</hi> which three in this Point being totally inconſiſtent each with other, every one by the leave of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who confirmed them all, may chuſe what Canonical Books he will have, whether thoſe in the <hi>Canons of the Apoſtles,</hi> or thoſe in the <hi>Council of Laodicea,</hi> or thoſe in that of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> and what pitiful incertainties are here? And now it is to little purpoſe to fly over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Centuries more till we come to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> theſe are late ones; and as our Learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Chriſtianorum Concilia, ſed Tyrannica Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſti Conventicula, ad oppugnandam Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi veritatem inſtituta;</hi> and thus it appears even Hiſtorically that the Authority of Scripture depends not on the Church. But waving this <hi>Popiſh Theſis,</hi> in which I have by the way made this long, Digreſſion: I proceed to the matter in hand.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:63874:177"/>
               <p>True Faith being a beam or irradiation from the holy Spirit, diſcovers, <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in general are the Word of God;</hi> and which is to the Point in hand, in its holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs it arrives at an <hi>experimental knowledg</hi> thereof; <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> wiſhes men to read the Bible ſeriouſly; and adds, <hi>Male ſit mihi (ita enim in tantâ causâ jurare auſim) niſi tandem capiantur, ſentient denique quantum divina haec ab humanis diſtent. Eraſmus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Expertus ſum in meipſo;</hi> That <hi>there is little good in curſory reading it; do it duly and you ſhall find the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine efficacy.</hi> That a Progreſſive Faith may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Experimental knowledg, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are of God, will appear by the enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>One noble piece of Scripture is <hi>the Moral Law; upon every apex of it hangs a mountain of Sence,</hi> ſay the Rabbins; every jot or tittle of it ſtands faſter than <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. This is the Summary of all Duties; all the Moral Precepts in Scripture are but as ſo many Commentaries on it. That this is of God, Faith experiments ſeveral ways:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith experiments it by the <hi>impreſſes and holy inclinations in the Believers heart,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, truly though not perſectly, to the Law. A Progreſſive Believer finds by reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That <hi>the Law is written in his heart;</hi> That his Heart is <hi>the very Epiſtle of Chriſt written by the holy Spirit:</hi> And withal he knows, that it was not always ſo; Time was, when there were
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:63874:178"/>no ſuch characters or holy inclinations there, his Heart was worſe than a meer empty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And hence he ſurely gathers, that thoſe characters or imprinted propenſities are the writing of God himſelf; and ſo comes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally to know the Epiſtle of God in Scripture by that in his Heart, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward literal Edition of the Law by the inward Spiritual one, which is a counterpane thereof, and anſwers thereunto as the ſtamp to the Seal, or one Tally to another. The mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them once diſcerned is a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proof, that both are of God, and written by one and the ſame holy hand. But you will ſay, there needs no Faith to make this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; the very Gentiles have the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Heart, their natural implanted Principles comprize both Tables; the firſt in that they tell us, that there is a God to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and reverenced; The ſecond in that they tell us, That we muſt do as we would be done to; which <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in. Unto which I anſwer, That there is a vaſt diſſerence between the natural Writing the Law in the Heart, and the gracious; The firſt is a relique or broken fragment of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image; its only or at leaſt chief ſeat is in the Underſtanding, and there it ſtands in the dark in an abyſs of black Ignorance; and in the mean while there is an helliſh enmity in the carnal will againſt the Law of God. But the other is a pure perfect thing which ſtands in both faculties, being as an <hi>holy lamp</hi> in the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63874:178"/>Underſtanding, and as a <hi>Divine inclination</hi> in the will to do the Commends of God. Hence it appears, That there is not that ſoundation for this experiment in the Natural Inſcription of the Law, as in the Gracious; the Natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gracious but as a little glimmering is to ſplendor; or as the broken pieces of a Picture are to the intire Image. It is with a Believer in this caſe as it was with <hi>Bezalceel;</hi> the Word of God came forth for making the Tabernacle, but <hi>Bezaleel</hi> had a fractical proof of it in the ſpirit of Wiſdom given him for the work: Or as it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> the Word came forth touching the Kingdom, but <hi>Saul</hi> had a Practical proof of it in the ſpirit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment vouchſafed unto him. And ſo it is with the Believer; <hi>The Divine Law is experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the ſpirit of obedience,</hi> and each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Command is proved by ſome inward aptneſs anſwering thereunto. A notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Inſcription we have in <hi>Maius</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Divine, who in his extream ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having Conſolatory Scriptures recited to him, bravely anſwered, <hi>Tace, tace, omnia cordi meo inſixa tenco;</hi> hold <hi>your peace, I have all in my heart:</hi> Promiſes I ſuppoſe he meant; and without diſpute the Precepts were there alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Faith experiments it by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence helping and comforting the Believer in acts of Obedience.</hi> The Rabbins ſay, <hi>That if two ſit together conſerring of the Law, the</hi> Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah <hi>is among them.</hi> And without doubt if but
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:63874:179"/>one ſingle Believer be not a talking meerly of the Law, but a doing of it, the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is with him. Thus the Prophet to <hi>Aſa, The Lord is with you, whileſt you be with him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. Thus our Saviour, <hi>If a man love him and keep his words, the Father and the Son will come and make their abode with ſuch a one,</hi> Joh. 14.23. Such an one hath a <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Shechinah</hi> in his Heart; God will be there helping and comforting of him in his well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Church prays for help from the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> Pſal. 20.2. becauſe that was a Symbol of Gods Preſence: And the obeying Believer cannot want help, becauſe he hath a <hi>Sanctuary within him.</hi> The way of the Lord is ſtrength to him, and waiting in it he renews ſtrength, and mounts up by Auxiliary Grace as <hi>upon Eagles-wings.</hi> Whileſt he is a doing the will of God <hi>ſtrength</hi> comes in, as it did to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites that bare the Ark, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.26. and with ſtrength <hi>holy comfort</hi> alſo; in keeping the Commands he hath great reward, inward peace, and joy unſpeakable; ſome of the oyl of Joy which is upon Chriſt the great Doer of Gods Will, drops down on the Believer in his ſincere Obedience. As all upright ones do, he dwels in Gods Preſence, as if he were in the borders of Heaven already; the light of Gods Countenance irradiates his Duties. When therefore the Believer reflects on himſelf, and conſiders, what a dry Land rebellion dwells in, and what rivers of Peace and Joy water Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; how weak and fooliſh his heart was
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63874:179"/>in doing his own will, and how help and ſtrength came upon him in doing Gods; he comes experimentally to know the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be of God, whoſe Preſence gave him ſuch comforts and aſſiſtances therein: The good hand of God upon him is a proof that the way is right; the Peace growing on his work ſhews the righteouſneſs of it. When in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time the queſtion was, whether God or <hi>Baal</hi> ſhould be God, the fire coming down from Heaven on the Sacrifice made the People fall down and confeſs, <hi>The Lord he is the God, the Lord he is the God,</hi> 1 King. 18.39. anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably when the Believer in the doing of Gods Commands, feels the illapſes of the holy Spirit inflaming and comforting his Heart, he ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experiences that God is in the Command of a truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Faith experiments it in that <hi>the hope of Heaven is enlarged and heightned in the doing of Gods will.</hi> The more a Believer doth it, the livelier is his Faith; the warmer his love, the ſtronger his other Graces; the meeter his Soul for Heaven, and the richer his <hi>entrance</hi> thereunto, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. He ſhall not go to Heaven poorly or with a ſeant wind, but with full gales and rich <hi>Plerophories;</hi> by ſucceſſive acts of Obedience his Hope riſes higher and higher, and ſo gives an experimental proof, That the Command is the very will of God, and way to Glory; otherwiſe Hope would not grow and flouriſh in it, but flag and wither; as it uſes to do in us, when we purſue our
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:63874:180"/>own ways. The Apoſtle would have men dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in good works, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to the full aſſurance of hope,</hi> Heb. 6.11. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t pleniſſimè in animis veſtris ſpes confirmetur,</hi> faith <hi>Beza.</hi> Immediately after the giving the Law God adds theſe words, <hi>Where ever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord my name, there will I come and bleſs you,</hi> Exod. 20.24. a bleſſing attends his Service. If God bleſs Obedience with an aſſurance of Hope, which is a fore-taſte of Heaven, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Glory; it is a full proof that his name is recorded in the Command. When a Believer walking therein comes to aſſurance, and ſo to be within ken of Heaven, he is ſure that the way is right.</p>
               <p>Another excellent part of Scripture ſtands in <hi>the Promiſes:</hi> Theſe are the Pearls of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, breaſts of Conſolation, and wells of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, flowing out to Believers in temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal good things; each of theſe Faith more or leſs experiments to be Divine.</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>Temporal Promiſes</hi> Faith expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments them in every bleſſing which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath. Indeed outward things are but the nether-ſprings, and bleſſings of the left hand, diſpenſed promiſcuouſly as if they were <hi>ludibria fortunae, the ſports of chance.</hi> Providence is ſtill ringing the changes; here an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> may have his portion and full cup; even Crowns and Kingdoms, which lie at the upper end of the World, may come to the <hi>baſeſt of men,</hi> Dan. 4.17.

Love or Hatred cannot be known by theſe things, not by them as they are in themſelves, or meerly iſſuing out of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: But the Believer hath them by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Priviledg, and in a way of Promiſe, and by reflection may know that he hath them ſo: When he doth not arrogate ought to himſelf, or like churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> all in his Poſſeſſives ſay, <hi>My bread, my water, and my fleſh;</hi> but really confeſs God to be ſupream Lord of all, and himſelf but an accountable Steward of them; When he can caſt his goods on the waters, and as it were ſend them to Sea in a voyage of Charity, expecting no return but in the other World, where theſe <hi>Corruptibles</hi> ſo uſed will riſe in <hi>the incorruption of eternal glory;</hi> When he can charge all outward things to ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in their own ſtation, and not approach that heart which is a facred Temple or holy place for God to dwell in; When he looks on all the World as forfeited by Sin, and new founded by Chriſt the Mediator, and ſo taſts his precious blood in every good thing, and gathers all his comforts from his reconciling Croſs; When upon a juſt call to Suffering he is willing to venture all his part in this life upon the meer Promiſe of a better, and had rather caſt all his Mundane pearls over board than hazard a wrack of Faith or Conſcience; When the pureſt ſweeteſt Comforts here below do not
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:63874:181"/>ſatisfic his Soul, as ſmelling of the cask and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of Creature-vanity, but in the fulleſt afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them he crys out, <hi>Dul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Such an experience multiplies the Loaves and wonderfully doubles and trebles the ſweetneſs and comfort of every Bleſſing. Some learned Men have obſerved a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jacobs</hi> Bleſſing and <hi>Eſaus; Jacobs</hi> runs thus, <hi>God give thee of the dew of Heaven, and the fatneſs of the Earth,</hi> Gen. 27.28. <hi>Eſaus</hi> thus, <hi>Thy dwelling ſhall be the fatneſs of the Earth, and of the dew of Heaven from above,</hi> ver. 39. In <hi>Jacobs</hi> the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned not in <hi>Eſaus:</hi> its true all Bleſſings are from God, but his <hi>name</hi> is mentioned in the one not in the other. The experienced Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath more of God and his federal Love in every Bleſſing than other Men. The <hi>Jews</hi> by a pious cuſtom uſed to ſay over their Bread, <hi>Bleſſed be God who brought Bread out of the Earth;</hi> over their Wine, <hi>Bleſſed be God who created the fruit of the Wine;</hi> over their Fruits, <hi>Bleſſed be God who created the Fruit of the Tree;</hi> nay, and over their Flowers, <hi>Bleſſed be God
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:63874:181"/>who made the ſweet ſmelling Herbs:</hi> and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they added this, <hi>Whoſoever takes ought out of this World without a benediction is as it were a robber of God.</hi> But the experienced Believer, as he hath a ſweeter title to theſe things; ſo he may raiſe up his Praiſes for them to an higher ſtrain than other Men; not only ſaying, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God and his <hi>Providence</hi> for ſuch and ſuch things, but bleſſed be God and his <hi>Promiſe</hi> alſo: All good things as well thoſe of this life, as thoſe of the other iſſue out of the Covenant of Grace. You will ſay, the Believer cannot yet make this experiment; for though he have ſome of the Temporal Bleſſings mentioned in the Promiſes, yet often and ordinarily he wants other of them. To which I anſwer, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Temporal Bleſſings are not abſolute, but carry a tacit limitation of expediency. The main deſign of the Promiſes is Mans Salvation, and to this Temporals are not, as Spirituals are, ſimply neceſſary; but only have a remote tendency thereunto, and that not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as they are over-ruled by God, who makes <hi>omnia cooperari in bonum, all things work together for good to them that love him.</hi> And hence the Believer expects from the Promiſes no other meaſure or proportion of outward things than what may conduce to his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and becauſe he knows not what that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or proportion is, he refers himſelf to the Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of God to order all for his good: and hence God doth not fulfil Promiſes of Temporals as he doth thoſe of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63874:182"/>Spirituals: Promiſes of Spirituals he fulfils in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> becauſe they cannot otherwiſe be made good, a drop of Grace being more worth than a World; but thoſe of Temporals he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fils <hi>disjunctively,</hi> either in the Bleſſing it ſelf, or in that which is equivalent by inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and ſupportation, compenſating the abſence of the thing it ſelf. Theſe things being ſo, the Believer in what he hath may experience the Promiſe in the true proportion and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; and not withſtanding his wants, may know, <hi>That in Chriſt he is ſo far heir of all things, that if he could want a world he ſhould have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching <hi>Spiritual Promiſes,</hi> theſe are either Promiſes of <hi>Grace,</hi> or Promiſes to <hi>Grace.</hi> As touching Promiſes of <hi>Grace,</hi> Faith may know theſe experimentally. The Believer reads in his Bible, That God hath promiſed <hi>to give an heart of fleſh, to make a new heart, and a new ſpirit, to write his Law in the heart, to give an heart to know him, to circumciſe the heart that it may love him;</hi> and many more ſuch-like: and afterwards reading over his own Heart, he may find theſe precious Graces all there, and be able experimentally to ſay of theſe Promiſes, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did of thoſe made to <hi>Iſrael, Not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord hath ſpoken, all are come to paſs,</hi> Joſh. 23.14. In every holy melting he finds <hi>the heart of fleſh;</hi> in every holy frame <hi>the new heart and ſpirit;</hi> in every holy inclination <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward engraven Law;</hi> in every holy beam the Divine Teaching; in every holy affection
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:63874:182"/>
                  <hi>the Spiritual Circumciſion;</hi> all the Promiſes are ſcaled and really exemplified in his Heart; and what an admirable experiment is this? To ſee a Work within anſwering to the Promiſe in the Word, is a greater ſight than if a Man could have ſtood by and ſeen the light ſtart forth into Being upon the Almighty <hi>fiat</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by God in the Creation; unto which the Apoſtle alludeth in ſetting forth the Divine light ſhining into the Heart in the face of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. The <hi>Magnalia</hi> of Grace are more wonderful than thoſe of nature. Hence St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>We are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus, Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. ſaith of Regeneration, That it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>really a Creation,</hi> and more noble than the old one; as adding a <hi>benè vivere</hi> to that life which came from the old one. The experienced Believer hath cauſe to ſay, what hath God wrought? how fearfully is the New Creature made? all its Graces were written in the Promiſe, and now are faſhioned in the Heart, where before there were none of them; How precious are thy thoughts to me, O God? how great is the ſum of them? This Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was notably typed out in <hi>Iſaac;</hi> he was by Promiſe; and as ſoon as he was born, the Promiſe was experimented notwithſtanding the dead body and dead womb. <hi>The Believer</hi> the child of Promiſe <hi>is as Iſaac was,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28. All the regenerating Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are by Promiſe; and when theſe are brought forth, the Promiſe is made good maugre all
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:63874:183"/>the deadneſs of nature. By the Promiſes <hi>we are made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. that is, we have thoſe Divine Graces which as the Creature-module will admit, reſemble the Holy One, and ſo we have the Promiſes ſealed up to us in Graces.</p>
               <p>As touching Promiſes made to <hi>Grace,</hi> ſuch as are fulfilled in this life, Faith alſo experiments them to be Divine. In the Scripture the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever meets with Promiſes of Pardon to ſuch as repent and believe; of comfort to the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of filling to the hungry and thirſty, of the Divine ſecret to them that fear God, of encreaſe of Grace to the improver; and many more of the ſame nature. To experiment theſe the Believer by peruſing the Scripture, and his own Heart, doth two things; firſt, He clears it up to himſelf, that the Graces in his Heart, to which ſuch Promiſes are made, are true, through the irradiating Spirit vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to him. He may diſcover them to be ſuch by Scriptural Marks, he may find that his Faith <hi>purifies and works by Love;</hi> That his Repentance and Mourning are chiefly for Sin; That his Hunger and Thirſt are humble and induſtrious in the uſe of means, That <hi>his Fear is of God and his Goodneſs</hi> in a filial way; That his improving of Talents is in a way of dependence and holy diligence; and ſo certainly knows that theſe Graces in his Heart are real things. This foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation being firſt laid, then he proceeds to a ſecond review of his Heart, and there he may find how Pardons have ſenſibly broke in upon
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63874:183"/>him in a way of Repenting and Believing, or how the Sheaves of Joy and Comfort have followed his Tears, or how Satisfactions <hi>Manna-like</hi> have dropped down on his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Soul, or how Divine illuminations have come in and Crowned his Holy Fear, or how Talents have multiplied in the faithful uſing and actuating of them: And the Experiment thereupon will be compleat, every Grace ſooner or later being in ſome good meaſure anſwered by the Promiſes, which let out their ſweetneſs to it as God hath ordained them to do. Thus the Believer ſenſibly enters the Land of Promiſe, and eats of the Fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, lifting up his Soul in <hi>The high Praiſes of him, who gave the Promiſes in the Scripture and fulfils them in the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching Promiſes of <hi>eternal good things in Heaven,</hi> where there are Plenitudes of Joy and Rivers of Pleaſure in the Preſence of Him who is <hi>All in All,</hi> the completion of theſe is in another World; nevertheleſs the Believer hath an experimental taſte thereof here. Whileſt his Hope hangs upon them, he finds ſtrength and comfort come into his Heart; whilſt the weary World is toſſing with troubles, O what a refreſhing is it to look into Eternity! Hope, <hi>Eatring within the vail, is an Anchor to the Soul;</hi> and ſo ſtabliſhes it, that it doth not rowl about with the wheelings of this change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able World, nor center its happineſs in any or all the Creatures. Let the World come in all its Fancies and glittering appearances of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:63874:184"/>Good, it cannot call off the Believers Heart from Heaven, but it will be ready to point that way; or let it come with ſtorms of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and troubles, it cannot looſen the Anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: the Believer will rather part with all the World, and his Life too, then let go his hold of Heaven: <hi>Ye took with joy the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ſelves, that ye have in Heaven a better and an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.34. Or, as the Words are in the Original; <hi>Knowing that ye have in your ſelves a better and abiding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Heaven.</hi> He ſpeaks as if they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Heaven in and about them, and in part they did ſo; for as <hi>Beza</hi> hath it on this place, <hi>Fide poſſidemus quod eſt in Coelis, By Faith we poſſeſs that which is in Heaven.</hi> All our Graces are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Things having or containing Salvation;</hi> No parts or pieces of this World, but ſuch as Heaven dawns and begins here below. The holy Spirit is as the <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> to aſſure us of the whole Crop in Heaven, and as <hi>the earneſt</hi> of the total Sum of Glory which ſhall be paid above. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever here hath ſo much of Heaven as to make him ſtrive, wreſtle, run, work, watch and wait with his Loyns girt and Lamps burning; and as the twelve Tribes to ſerve God <hi>inſtantly, Acts</hi> 26.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; running with full ſpeed, and ſtretching out himſelf in the Race, that he may come to the Crown of Life; and ſurely, his Hope, if faſtned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a nullity, would not put forth ſuch
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63874:184"/>ſtrong and vigorous operations. Heaven muſt be a real thing indeed, which ſo carries away the Heart from all the World and engages it unto it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Another conſiderable part of Scripture ſtands in <hi>threatnings againſt Sinners.</hi> Touching experimenting theſe, I need ſay very little: our Good God doth not give out Threatnings in the ſame manner as he doth give out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; he gives out Promiſes that they may be fulfilled and experimented; but he gives out Threatnings that they may not be fulfilled and experimented, but rather that by them Men may be warned in a way of Faith and Repentance <hi>To fly from the wrath to come.</hi> The applying of a Promiſe in a right manner makes it to belong to us, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of a Threatning makes it not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us: judging our ſelves we prevent the Judgment of God. The Believer even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion more or leſs felt the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings taking hold of him, and ſhutting of him up under Wrath, till Jeſus Chriſt opened the Priſon-dores and made him Free indeed: And if afte Converſion he forget the old Chains, and run into wilful Rebellion again, he will feel them a ſecond time; <hi>The bones will be broken</hi> and Comforts loſt, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be wounded, and the Wounds will <hi>Stink and be corrupt becauſe of his fooliſhneſs.</hi> God may depart away, and leave the Graces withering, and the poor Soul all in the dark with Terrors round about it: This is a very
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:63874:185"/>ſad Experiment; and yet undeniably proves that the Threatnings are from God, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice appearing on the top of them like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Fire.</p>
               <p>Paſſing over thoſe three great Pillars of Scripture Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings; I now proceed to the Sacred Truths, which lie therein, as Rich Veins of Gold and Silver do in a Mine: And to avoid Prolixity, I ſhall pick out of them ſome ſupernatural Ones, ſuch as cannot be known by the mere Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but drop down from Heaven in a way of pure Revelation; concluding with my ſelf, That if Faith can make an Experiment in theſe, it may much more do ſo in others. I ſhall firſt inſtance in that Sacred Truth of <hi>The bleſſed Trinity of Perſons in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the God-head:</hi> This is, as one hath it, <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Fundamentorum, The Foundation of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;</hi> unleſs this ſtand faſt all Evangelical Truths fall to the Ground; we are no longer Chriſtians then we acknowledg it. So ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime is this Myſtery, that as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Scrutari haec temeritas eſt, credere pietas eſt, noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vero vita aeterna eſt.</hi> And when <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> was preſſed to aſſign a diſſerence between thoſe words, <hi>Begotten</hi> and <hi>Proceeding,</hi> he made this anſwer, <hi>Dic mihi, quid ſit gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, &amp; ego dicam, quid ſit proceſſio, ut ambo inſaniamus; diſtinguere inter proceſſionem &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerationem neſcio, non valeo, non ſufficio.</hi> This Truth is totally ſupernatural; it could never without a Revelation enter into our Heart;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63874:185"/>humane reaſon; no, not that of <hi>Adam</hi> could not reach it. Indeed there are ſtrange paſſages touching it in <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> and <hi>Plato: Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſtus</hi> ſaith, <hi>God who is Mind begat <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, three <hi>Perſons in one.</hi> But ſure theſe men knew nothing of this Myſtery; if they ſpake ſomewhat like, they ſpake not the ſame; or if the ſame, they borrowed it from <hi>Moſes. Plato</hi> is called the <hi>Atticizing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> and his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is taken from <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>I am.</hi> Or, which is moſt probable, the notions of the Trinity in <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> were foiſted into their Works. How many Books have been put out under the names of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> which have not been truly ſuch? Such impoſture in the Primitive times was very ordinary: And if Men would be thus bold with Apoſtles and Fathers, what might they not do in Heathens? Beſides, ſome think there are clearer notions of a Trinity in ſome of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> than in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Books, and ſo by conſequence <hi>the Heathens</hi> ſhould know more of it than <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which is contrary to the Scriptures, which tell us, <hi>In Judah is God known,</hi> Pſ. 76.1. and <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63874:186"/>any Nation,</hi> Pſ. 147.20. It is therfore likely that ſuch paſſages in Heathens were inſerted into their Books, by Chriſtians, in a way of Pious Fraud, ſuch as was anciently uſed. This Sacred Myſtery was intimated in the <hi>Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; Elohim</hi> in the plural, <hi>Created,</hi> Gen. 1.1. <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them by the Spirit of his Mouth,</hi> Pſ. 33.6. <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> I ſay 6.3. The ancient <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> (as <hi>Petrus Galatinus</hi> hath ſhewed) embraced this Doctrine. <hi>Rabbi Simeon</hi> on that in the Prophet, ſaith, <hi>Sanctus, hic eſt Pater, Sanctus, hic eſt Filius, Sanctus, hic eſt Spiritus Sanctus:</hi> the three <hi>Middoth,</hi> or <hi>Properties</hi> in Rabbinical Writers, are the three Perſons in the Godhead. And the Cabbaliſts have theſe words, <hi>Pater Deus, Filius Deus, Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Deus, Tres in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>no, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus in Tribus.</hi> In the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> we have this Truth clearly laid down; in the Baptiſin of Chriſt we have all the three Perſons appearing, <hi>The Father in a Voice, the Son in the Fleſh, the Holy Ghoſt in the Dove, Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. The Primitive Chriſtians uſed to ſay to any that doubted of the <hi>Trinity, Abi ad Jordanem &amp; videbis, Go to Jordan and you will ſee it.</hi> Chriſt Commands.

And again, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were improperly <hi>Baptized into Moſes;</hi> they were not aſperſed or immerged in water, neither was Baptiſm then an Ordinance of God as now it is.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:63874:187"/>the Trinity. The learned <hi>Stephens</hi> ſaith, That place is wanting in ſeven <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, but it is found in nine more ancient.

Had it not then been in St. <hi>John, Arrius</hi> would have eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it. I believe in the times of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrians</hi> blotted out theſe words as moſt pregnant againſt them, out of divers Copies. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> aſſerted the truth of our reading from the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies which he had; publickly conteſting, That in thoſe Copies where it was wanting, it was razed out by the fraud of Hereticks. And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That the Hereticks did erade that place. This Truth ſtands faſt in Scripture for ever and ever; and Faith embraces it. And which is more and to the Point in hand, Faith in its holy progreſs may, as I conceive, experience it. My reaſon is, the Church in all Ages down from the Apoſtles have worſhipped the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity; Their Baptiſm hath been in its Name; their Doxology and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it; their Creeds all publiſh it; their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeni</hi> were trained up in the knowledg of it; they ever worſhipped, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath it in his Creed, <hi>one God in Trinity, and Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> and that <hi>uno indiviſo cultu,</hi> as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſpeak. This in all Ages hath been the Chriſtian Worſhip; and upon this Worſhip anſwers and returns have come down from
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63874:187"/>Heaven in abundance of Glorious Spiritual Bleſſings, ſuch as are comprized in that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Prayer, <hi>The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all, Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. The whole Trinity is adored, and the whole Trinity vouchſafes Gracious returns; <hi>Gratia quae datur, in Trinitate datur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius.</hi> Every Believer ſo worſhipping hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from Heaven; and the Progreſſive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may know that he hath them; and in the experience thereof may experience That there is a <hi>Sacred Trinity of a truth.</hi> If the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> be a <hi>nullity,</hi> or as <hi>Servetus</hi> blaſphemouſly ſaid, An Idol, or <hi>three-headed Cerberus;</hi> Or, as <hi>Socinus</hi> belched out his impiety, <hi>A ridiculous invention of humane curioſity:</hi> Then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip is no other than ſtrange fire, vain' Will-worſhip, and Idol-worſhip; nay, it is no Worſhip at all; <hi>none,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> its ſuppoſed Object is a <hi>nullity; none,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God looks on it as <hi>none.</hi> As when the <hi>Samaritans feared the Lord and ſerved their Idols,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.33. The Text ſaith in the very next ver. <hi>That they feared not the Lord;</hi> their fear was as none, becauſe of the mixture of Idol-worſhip: So when Chriſtians worſhip one God, and a <hi>Trinity</hi> which is not, their Worſhip is as none at all. Upon ſuch a Worſhip God will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his eyes unleſs to puniſh it, nor make any returns but thoſe of Wrath. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> worſhipped the Golden Calf, Gods Wrath waxed hot, and was ready to conſume them;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63874:188"/>much more may it do ſo, if Chriſtians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a <hi>Trinity</hi> which is not. In that of the Calf, as they meant it, there was only error <hi>in modo,</hi> for they intended not to terminate their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Calf but in God, as appears by their own words, <hi>To marrow is a feaſt to Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> Exod. 32.5. But in this of a Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Trinity,</hi> there is <hi>error in objectio ultimo,</hi> which is more provoking to God. If the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be but the Idol of the brain, God will no more be enquired of by its Worſhippers than he would by thoſe who <hi>ſet up their Idols in their heart.</hi> Ezek. 14.3. no gracious returns are found in ſuch a ſalfe way. A Believer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who in Worſhipping one God in Trinity, finds returns ſrequently and ſucceſſively after Duties from the Mercy-ſcat, carries an inward ſeal and proof in his boſom, that there is a <hi>Trinity.</hi> This experimental proof of a <hi>Trinity</hi> ſeems to me evident in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3. He ſaith not barely, Our fellowſhip is with God, but <hi>with the Father and the Son;</hi> neither doth he ſay it at peradventures, but as a ſure known thing, ſuch as hath the joy of the holy Spirit with it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> to be <hi>knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Myſtery of God, and of the Father and of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.2.

               <p>In the next place I proceed to the rare Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Truths touching <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> all which Faith may experiment. And here I ſhall begin with his <hi>Incarnation. Venit univerſitatis Creator, venit ad homines, venit propter homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, venit homo,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> He was <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, God with us;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God and Man</hi> in one Perſon; <hi>The Eternal Word was made fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>God was manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. And what ſay the <hi>Socinian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> to this Truth? <hi>Rationi ſanae repugnat; duae ſubſtantiae proprietatibus adverſae coire in unam perſonam nequeunt, ut ſunt mortalem &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem eſſe, principium habere &amp; principie carere, mutabilem &amp; immutabilem exiſtere,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Racovian Catechiſm:</hi> One and the ſame Perſon cannot be Mortal and Immortal, have a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and no Beginning, or be Mutable &amp; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable. But reaſon it ſelf, though too low a bar for this Truth to appear at, will abſolve this truth from repugnancy: Body and Soul meet in one Perſon, adverſe in Properties; the one being Corporal, the other Spiritual; the one Viſible, the other Inviſible; the one Rational, the other Irrational; the one Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the other Immortal. This is done naturally,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63874:189"/>how much more may it be done Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally? It would be againſt reaſon to ſay, That Chriſt were <hi>Secundum idem,</hi> Mortal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, having a Beginning and none; Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Immutable; But it is not repugnant to ſay, That he is ſo in reſpect of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Humane and Divine. Had not Chriſt been Man, he could not have <hi>ſuffered;</hi> had he not been God, he could not have <hi>ſatisfied:</hi> The Blood was from the Humane Nature, and the excellent Merit from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. He that disbelieves either, muſt caſt away Scripture which aſſerts both. This Truth ſtands firm in Scripture, as might be ſhewed at large; but for the Point in hand, Faith may experiment it. The Believer may find in himſelf ſuch fruits of Chriſts Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as carry a reſemblance thereunto, and are a kind of inward Seal thereof. The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſt was not brought forth of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>generatione ſed juſſione,</hi> not in an ordinary way by knowing a man, but in an extraordinary, by <hi>the power of the higheſt and overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Anſwerably in the Believer, the new Creature is not born of <hi>blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, John</hi> 1.13. He that is ſuch hath not known man nor his power in this great Work, but hath had the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and its gracious overſhadowings on the heart. They that dwell <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63874:190"/>we ſhall have no hearts to return to him. This reſemblance is excellently ſet forth by <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; Forma praeceſſit in carne Chriſti, quam in noſtrá ſide ſpiritualiter agnoſeamus;</hi>

                     </expan> credentis, quo Spiritu ſecundum carnem formatus eſt in utero Virginis;</hi> The very ſame Spirit which formed Chriſt in the womb, forms him in the heart. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature in Chriſt was united to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in an Hypoſtatical Union; God and Man met in one Perſon, that they might meet in the Covenant of Grace: Anſwerably the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is united unto God in a ſpiritual Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union, <hi>He is made one Spirit with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. Chriſt was one fleſh with us, and we are one Spirit with him; God is at one with us in Chriſt, and we may approach to God with holy boldneſs. The Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt had no natural Subſiſtence, but ſubſiſted in the eternal Word; ſutably the new Creature hath no ſpiritual Subſiſtence in it ſelf, but ſubſiſts in God and his Grace; <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. St. <hi>Paul</hi> looked on his ſpiritual Being to be only by Grace. In Chriſt <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>tabernacled in it;</hi> nay, <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead dwelt in it, Col.</hi> 2.10. As low abject a thing as Humane nature is, the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in it, and will dwell in it for ever; ſutably in Believers <hi>the Tabernacle of God is with men, he dwells and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63874:190"/>walks in them,</hi> and <hi>they may be filled with all the fulneſs of God, Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. that is, have abundance of his gracious Preſence with them. A Believer may find that he hath theſe reſembling fruits in himſelf, and withal that, unleſs the Son of God had been incarnate, none of them would have been; no new Creature, but all men lying in the old rubbiſh of the Fall; no Union, but an unpaſſable gulf ſuch as is between Heaven and Hell; no ſpiritual Subſiſtence, but a corrupt one upon the dregs of Free-will; no heavenly Fulneſs, but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of all Grace: And from hence he may have an experimental proof of Chriſts Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Myſtical Union being a proof of the Hypoſtatical, and God manifeſt in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God manifeſt in the Fleſh. St. <hi>John</hi> lays down this as a glorious Truth, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.5. and for proof of it he produces ſix Witneſſes; <hi>Three in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, ver.</hi> 7. and <hi>Three on earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, ver.</hi> 8. By the <hi>Spirit</hi> we may underſtand the holy Spirit breathing in the Scripture, and witneſſing in the heart; by <hi>the Water</hi> the ſanctifying Graces and thoſe ſealed in Baptiſm; and <hi>by the Blood</hi> the precious Sufferings of Chriſt which pacifie the Conſcience: A Believer may experience all theſe three Witneſſes on Earth, and ſo may experience the Incarnation of Chriſt. But to go on unto this of the Incarnation, I ſhall add two inſtances more touching Chriſt; the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63874:191"/>one is his <hi>Death,</hi> and the other is his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> The experiment of both is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſet forth by St. <hi>Paul, That I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Death,</hi> Phil. 3.10. <hi>Tune recte cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcitur Chriſtus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin, dum ſentimus quid valeat Mors ejus &amp; Reſurrectio; Then we truly know Chriſt, when we feel the power of his Death and Reſurrection in our own hearts.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt died for us, <hi>His Soul was an offering for Sin, his Life</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a Ranſom for many;</hi> He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Gods Juſtice, opened a door of Mercy, and procured the effuſion of the holy Spirit; and all this Faith may experiment. In the calms of Conſcience the Believer may feel the atoning Blood of Chriſt, <hi>purging his heart from dead works to ſerve the living God;</hi> In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of Luſts he may find a ſecret virtue from Chriſt crucified, enabling him for the work; In all the ſweet gales and operations of the holy Spirit he hath a proof of that meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſion which procured them; and when he ſtumbles and falls into ſin and drives away that Spirit for a time, in its return he hath a proof, <hi>that Chriſt is a Prieſt after the Power of an endleſs life.</hi> The vexed grieved Spirit might utterly forſake ſuch faultring backſliding Creatures as we are, and leave us deſolate for an habitation of Devils and unclean ſpirits for ever; but the <hi>endleſs life</hi> of Merit in Chriſt cauſes it to return to us again, and thereby gives us a moſt precious experiment thereof. At <hi>Swerin</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> there was a little drop
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:63874:191"/>of Blood included in a Jaſper-ſtone, given out to be the very Blood of Chriſt: This every <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> at a certain hour was ſhewn, and upon view ſeemed to open and draw out it ſelf, as it were in three parts, and then to go together again: It was followed by great concourſes of people, and eſteemed very Sacred for 300 years. Had this Toy been true and genuine, I might yet ſay as <hi>Maius</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Divine did to one, who asked him, If it would not be a great Conſolation to a poor Thief ready to die, to be told, That Chriſt according to the Fleſh is ſo near him, that even <hi>in fune</hi> he may have him? <hi>At melius in corde,</hi> 'tis better having the Blood of Chriſt in the heart than any other way; ſuch an having produces the glorious Experiments before ſpoken of. And as the Death of Chriſt is experimented, ſo is <hi>his Reſurrection.</hi> In the Peace of God the Believer may read that the Debt is fully paid, and the Surety out of the priſon of the Grave; In the inward ſpiritual Reſurrecton he may find <hi>that Almighty power which raiſed up Jeſus from the dead;</hi> In heavenly elevations and affections he may feel holy touches from Chriſt <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> and attracting his Heart into the upper world: In the excellent miniſterial Gifts in the Church he may know that <hi>Chriſt is above,</hi> and lets drop theſe for the perfecting of the Saints; and in his <hi>lively hope of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Inheritance,</hi> he may prove <hi>the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt by which he is begotten again unto it.</hi> Such Experiments as theſe wonderfully ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63874:192"/>the Faith of Believers, oyl their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and multiply their Joy and Peace in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and make each of them able to ſay in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>Chriſt died for me,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt roſe again for me;</hi> and lo here are the Witneſſes of it in my heart.</p>
               <p>Unto theſe faced Truths of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I ſhall only add one Inſtance more touching <hi>the efficacy of Grace in the hearts of men.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians,</hi> thoſe <hi>Inimici gratiae,</hi> aſcribe almoſt all to Free will, and little or nothing to Free-grace; making Grace rather to conſiſt in the external Doctrine than in internal Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: or if they admit any thing internal, it is rather in the illumination of the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than in the change of the Will. But the Scriptures tells us clean contrary, of <hi>opening the heart</hi> and <hi>new-making it;</hi> of <hi>working the Will,</hi> and a <hi>day of power</hi> cauſing it; of <hi>raiſing the ſpiritually dead and creating us again in Chriſt;</hi> of <hi>putting his Spirit into us, and cauſing us to walk in his Statutes:</hi> Theſe and many more Scriptures loudly proclaim the power of Grace, and the Believer may experience it. This is the clearer, becauſe the <hi>ſenſus communis</hi> of Chriſtians hath in all Ages run this way. <hi>David</hi> upon the willing Offering utters his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Grace in a way of admiration; <hi>Who am I and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort! For all things come of thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. <hi>All things come of thee,</hi> even willingneſs and All: In ſo Offering we do but give of thine own, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians uſe to ſay in their Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <p>The Divine Experiments of Faith in Scripture-Ordinances, Baptiſm, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, Prayer, and the Lords Supper; and laſtly in the great Works of Power recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the next place I proceed to the <hi>Divine Ordinances</hi> in Scripture: Theſe the Believer may experience to be Divine. God bare ſuch a Teſtimony to the Typical Ordinances under the Law, that his People experimentally knew that they were from him. In <hi>Circumciſion</hi> God ſet his Seal and Love-mark on his ancient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and at the doing of it they bleſſed him, that a Child was brought into Covenant. In their <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> fire from Heaven conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them as a witneſs of their acceptation. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prays, <hi>The Lord accept thy Burnt-ſacriſice,</hi> Pſal. 20.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in cinerem vertat; let him turn it to aſhes,</hi> thereby teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his acceptance thereof. In their <hi>firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> they had many Symbols of Gods Preſence, as <hi>the Ark</hi> with <hi>the Tables</hi> in it, and <hi>Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or Mercy-ſeat;</hi> by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummin</hi> they could ask Counſel of God; the <hi>Shechinab,</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:63874:194"/>the <hi>Glory</hi> or <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God dwelt between the <hi>Cherubims;</hi> and acceptance in their Services and Sacrifices offered unto God. But preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe as being but Shadows, and by Chriſtians experimented in Jeſus Chriſt the ſubſtance of them; I ſhall inſtance in the four great ſtanding Ordinances in the Chriſtian Church; and ſhew how the Believer may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience them to be from God, and in that experience prove the Scripture, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them, to be from him alſo.</p>
               <p>The firſt Ordinance I ſhall inſtance in is that of <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> This by the Ancients was ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Illumination,</hi> as uſhering in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical light. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> calls it <hi>Veſtimentum candidum &amp; ſignaculum ſancium,</hi> the <hi>white garment and holy ſign.</hi> It is by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Porta Gratiae,</hi> the <hi>door of Grace,</hi> and firſt entrance into the Church. And by St. <hi>Bernard, Chriſtianiſmi inveſtitura,</hi> the <hi>firſt putting on Chriſtianity.</hi> In <hi>Luther</hi> it is, <hi>Aqua non Creato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſed Dei ſalvatoris,</hi> the <hi>water not of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor but of God the Saviour.</hi> Among the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Proſelyte of the Gates</hi> was only tyed to the ſeven Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> but the <hi>Proſelyte of Righteouſneſs</hi> was bound to all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ordinances, and was initiated into <hi>Judaiſin</hi> by Circumciſion and Baptiſm, and the blood of Oblation. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins built this Baptiſm of Proſelytes on that Command of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10. <hi>That the people ſhould ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63874:195"/>themſelves, and waſh their clothes,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the reception of the Law. Such as were Baptized they called, <hi>Renati, new-born,</hi> or <hi>regenerate;</hi> and reputed them to be <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alis Divinae Majeſtatis, under the wings of the Divine Majeſty.</hi> But as yet <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance but only a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtom. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards this cuſtom was turned into a ſacred Ordinance in <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which was <hi>not of Men but from Heaven:</hi> He ſaith of himſelf, <hi>That he was ſent to Baptize,</hi> Joh. 1.33. And by whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>The word of the Lord came</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>upon John,</hi> Luk. 3.2. as a Divine Warrant for the Work. His Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is called, <hi>The Counſel of God,</hi> Luk. 7.30. And was ſealed from Heaven by a wonderful <hi>Theophany,</hi> the whole Sacred Trinity mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting themſelves at Chriſts Baptiſm by him. Afterwards Chriſt gave a ſolemn charge about it, <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28.19. and adds a ſweet Promiſe thereunto, <hi>Lo I am with you alway even to the end of the world,</hi> ver. 20. Thus Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is firmly eſtabliſhed in Scripture, and the Believer may experience it to be of God: He, though Baptized an Infant, wanting the uſe of Reaſon, and uncapable in himſelf to make any formal Vow or Covenant; yet finds a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret bond or obligation lying upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which remembers him of his Baptiſm in ſome ſuch words as thoſe of an Ancient; <hi>Abrenunciaſti Diabolo &amp; operibus ſuis, abrenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaſti
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63874:195"/>ſeculo &amp; voluptatibus ejus; Thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Devil and his works, the World and its pleaſures, forget not thy Baptiſm.</hi> And the reaſon of this bond is, becauſe <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is an Ordinance of <hi>Stipulation,</hi> called by St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the ſtipulation or interrogation of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. It is an entry into Covenant with God, and binds the Conſcience. Were it no Ordinance of God, there would be no Stipulation, and ſo no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon Conſcience. But when the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever finds his Baptiſmal Vow preſſing there, he knows that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is of God. Again, he knows it by <hi>the inward ſtrength and power</hi> which he receives from thence. The virtue of Baptiſm follows the Believer, as the water of the Rock did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in all the travels of this World even to his dying hour; at which the oldeſt higheſt Saint may refreſh himſelf by running back to his Baptiſm. When <hi>temptations</hi> come and aſſault the Believer, when Satan caſts in his fiery darts to inflame the Corruption of the Heart, the Believer is the ſtronger to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe them, becauſe of Baptiſm. A pious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as <hi>Luther</hi> relates, uſed to oppoſe this to every Temptation, <hi>Baptizata ſum, mhil facis Satan; I am Baptized, O Satan, thou canſt do nothing.</hi> In the <hi>African</hi> Perſecution under <hi>Hunericus,</hi> one <hi>Majoricus</hi> a fine young Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought forth to ſuffer for the Truth, was thus confirmed therein by his Mother <hi>Dionyſia; Memento, mi ſili, nos in nomine Sacro-ſanciae Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adis in Eccleſia eſſe Baptizatos; ah! ne perda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus illud precioſiſſimum indumentum, ne veniens,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63874:196"/>qui ad nuptias nos vocavit, non reperiat veſtem nuptialem, &amp; in tenebras exteriores ejiciamur;</hi> Remember, O my Son, that we were Baptized in the Name of the Sacred Trinity; let us not loſe this precious Garment, leſt when he comes who called us to the Wedding, he find no Wedding garment, and we be caſt into utter darkneſs. This ſo ſtrengthened the Young Man, that he ſuffered as a glorious Martyr for the Truth.</p>
               <p>In Baptiſm we are liſted land enrolled into Chriſts <hi>Militia,</hi> and ſo go not to war at our own charge; but the great <hi>Captain of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is with us, and ſtrengthens us againſt Temptation. About the year of our Lord 433, the <hi>Burgundiuns</hi> were grievouſly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Huns</hi> and finding no relief among Mortals, they applied themſelves to the gods; and there being a great crond of <hi>Numens,</hi> at laſt they pitched on the <hi>God of the Chriſtians,</hi> as moſt potent and preſent in Perils, and were Baptized, giving up themſelves to Chriſt; after their Baptiſm they went to fight with the <hi>Huns,</hi> and with a few overcome many thouſands of them: And I ſuppoſe they fought as well and were as good Soldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt inward Temptations as againſt outward Enemies; for the Story ſaith, <hi>Ab eo tempore ardenti amore flagrabant in conſervando Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſmo;</hi> From that time they burned with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love to Chriſtianity. Thus they had a double ſignal proof of their Baptiſm, in the ſtrength and Divine aſſiſtance afforded them
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63874:196"/>againſt outward and in ward Enemies. Moreover the Believer may find in himſelf thoſe Divine Bleſſings which are <hi>ſealed up in Baptiſm,</hi> and ſo prove it to be of God. <hi>Baptiſm ſeals up Regeneration,</hi> and is therefore called by the Apoſtle the <hi>Laver of Regeneration,</hi> Tit. 3.5. And the Believer may find the New-birth in himſelf, <hi>We know that we are of God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.19. Baptiſm ſeals <hi>our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt;</hi> and hence we are ſaid therein <hi>To put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3 27. and <hi>To be buried with Chriſt, and riſen with Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.12. Which two are notably adumbrated in the Baptiſmal Immerſion into the water, and Eduction out of it. And the Believer may know his Union with Chriſt; he may not only believe, That Chriſt is come <hi>in carne Mariae,</hi> but ſhew that he is come <hi>in carne ſua,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaks; he may not only believe, That Chriſt died and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the fleſh which he took of <hi>Mary,</hi> but ſhew that he is dead and riſen <hi>in the Believer;</hi> that is, Chriſts Death and Reſurrection are ſelt in his Mortification and Vivification. Baptiſm ſeals <hi>Remiſſion and divine Favour;</hi> hence we read of <hi>Baptiſing for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Act. 2.38. and the Believer may be able to read his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſee Heaven as it were open to him in the gracious favour of God. Thus by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing the Divine Bleſſings ſealed in Baptiſm, he may ſatisfactorily prove to himſelf, That Baptiſm is an Ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>In the next place I ſhall inſtance in the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word. This (however ſlighted
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63874:197"/>of late, ſome Papiſts calling the Proteſtant Miniſters in a ſcoff, <hi>Praedicantici;</hi> and ſome Proteſtants, ſuch as they are, calling Preaching <hi>Prating,</hi>) is yet a great Ordinance of God ſuch as hath had a ſtanding in the Church in all Ages. God himſelf was <hi>the firſt Preacher,</hi> firſt promulgating to Man his ſolemn Command touching the forbidden fruit; and after the Fall, that <hi>Protevangelium</hi> in the Promiſe of the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> that is, the <hi>Meſſias. Adam</hi> (as <hi>Franzius</hi> probably conjectures) was wont at his Sacrifices for nine hundred years to preach of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed. <hi>Enoch</hi> as early as he was in the World preached of the laſt day, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints,</hi> Jude <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>a preacher of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.5. and without doubt told them of the approaching Deluge. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> his <hi>Incipients or initiated Ones,</hi> whom he taught in the Divine Law as well as in arms. Afterwards in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time there were Prieſts and Levites to expound the Law to the people. In <hi>Samuel</hi>'s time there were Colledges of Prophets, and there the Word was preached to the people: In theſe Colledges was the firſt riſe of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and that of <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.18, 20. is tranſlated by <hi>the Chaldee Paraphraſt, Domus Doctrinae, the Houſe of Learning,</hi> becauſe there the Word of God was taught. The Great <hi>Solomon</hi> was a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heleth</hi> or Preacher; his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> is a Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Sermon of the Vanity of all things. The
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63874:197"/>Prophets were Preachers of the Word, and ſo were the Scribes, who were therefore called <hi>Text-Men</hi> or <hi>Maſters of the Text;</hi> and ſaid to ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Chair,</hi> becauſe they expounded the Law. Alſo in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church they did by the Impoſition of hands called <hi>Semiea,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Presbyters; ſome of whom were for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, and others for Teaching the Law: Thus Preaching came down ſucceſſively to the Times of the Goſpel, in which we have a ſolemn Command <hi>To Preach to every Creature; To be inſtant in ſeaſon out of ſeaſon, To labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> nay, <hi>To travail in birth till Chriſt be formed in men.</hi> The Apoſtles, after their Maſter Jeſus Chriſt who was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Preachers, diſperſed themſelves up and down the world to propagate the Goſpel. <hi>Paul</hi> went Preaching from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Mark</hi> was in <hi>Egypt, Matthew</hi> in <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, Thomas</hi> in <hi>India, Simon Zelotes</hi> in <hi>Britam,</hi> and others in other places, all labouring in the ſame Work. After the Death of the Apoſtles, this Ordinance was much eſteemed in ſucceeding ages. Anciently the very <hi>Biſhops of Rome</hi> were wont to Preach; and in the ſuppoſed Epiſtle of <hi>Clement</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the Brother of the Lord, mention is made of <hi>quotidiana Praedicatio. Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of feeding the peoples Faith <hi>Sanctis Vocibus, with holy Words;</hi> And <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnes Epiſcapi erudiunt, all the Biſhops Preach.</hi> In the <hi>Old,</hi> though not, as they are called, <hi>Apoſtolical Canons,</hi> we have this; <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus non docens deponatur, Let the not-preaching
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:63874:198"/>Biſhop be depoſed:</hi> and in the <hi>Old,</hi> though not, as named, <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions;</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was, <hi>firſt one Presbyter preached, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and laſt of all the Biſhop.</hi> At this time there was good ſtore of Preaching. <hi>Damaſus the Firſt,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>de Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repiſcopis,</hi> ſhews how unlike Chriſt they are who preach not; <hi>Ipſe enim docuit, ipſe ovem perditam quaeſivit, ipſe propriis humeris reportavit;</hi> Chriſt did all himſelf. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> preached every day; <hi>ye heard yeſterday, ye ſhall hear to morrow,</hi> is common in their Homilies. Many of the Writings of <hi>Ambroſe, Nazianzen, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> were only their Sermons to the People; and therefore in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio Vaſenſi</hi> held about the Year of our Lord 440, it was ordered, That if the Presbyter were ſick and unable to Preach, <hi>Sanctorum Patrum Homiliae à Diaconis recitentur; The Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ſhould read the Homilies of the holy Fathers. Gregory the Great</hi> in his Paſtoral, ſaith, <hi>Qui verbum praedicationis ſubtrabunt, animabus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientibus vitae remedia abſcondunt; The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching Miniſter hides the Bread of Life from dying ſouls.</hi> The fourth <hi>Toletan Council,</hi> which was a little after <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omne opus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum in praedicatione conſiſtit, Preaching is a Miniſters All.</hi> In the <hi>Council of Mentz</hi> under <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> It was Ordered, <hi>Can.</hi> 25. <hi>Nunquam deſit diebus Dominicis qui Verbum Dei Praedicet; On Sabbath days a Preacher muſt not be wanting;</hi> No, though the Biſliop be ſick it muſt not, as that Can. ſaith. In the <hi>Oxford Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:63874:198"/>made by <hi>Archbiſhop Stephen,</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is enjoined, <hi>ne canes muti merito judicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Nay, the very <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> ſaith, that Preaching is <hi>praecipuum munus Epiſcopi, the chief work of a Biſhop.</hi> Such an Ordinance is this, and ſo highly eſteemed in all Ages, no wonder if <hi>Biſhop Morton</hi> ſaid, <hi>The cuſtom of not-Preaching is but a Babe in Chriſtianity, and the defence thereof a new point of Learning in Chriſts School.</hi> But to return to the Point in hand after this long digreſſion; the Believer may experience this Ordinance to be of God. That it is ſo, is in part expermented before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Whileſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> but a Priſoner preached of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Temperance and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, Felix</hi> though a Judg <hi>trembled,</hi> feeling moral bonds caſt on his Conſcience by the Power of that Word which is never bound. It is yet more fully experimented in Converſion, in which there is a wonderful change wrought; the dead being raiſed, new Creatures formed, Lyons turned into Lambs, and hearts of Stone into Fleſh; all proclaiming that the Finger of God is in it of a Truth. <hi>Johannes Speicerus,</hi> as <hi>Scultetus</hi> relates, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo powerfully, That <hi>the very Strumpets, leaving their lewdneſs, returned home unto God.</hi> After Converſion the Experiment is yet more compleat; the Word <hi>works effectually in them that believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. The glory of the Divine Attributes break forth in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; out of the <hi>ſeeming weakneſs</hi> a <hi>Majeſty</hi> appears in ſome ſort, much as Chriſts Deity
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63874:199"/>ſparkled out of his Humane Fleſh. It is not the meer Voice of Man but of God, coming with an Authority more than Humane, and ſetting the heart, made like <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s tender by Faith, into an holy trembling at it, as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proof, that the Lord is the Speaker; One who hath the Keys of Heaven and Hell in his own hand, and upon Obedience or Rebellion is able to ſave or deſtroy. The Believer by the command and reverential awe put upon his Conſcience, finds That there is a Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and <hi>Grandeur</hi> in it, which to oppoſe, is to ſtrive and make War with God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, out of the ſeeming <hi>fooliſhneſs wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> diſcovers it ſelf. Whileſt but a man is teaching outwardly to the ear, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teacher in the heart: The Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation uncovers the holy things, and brings forth this or that ſacred Myſtery to the View, <hi>Intus datur, intus coruſcat, intus revelatur,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſſes it. The Father of Lights ſhews himſelf there in ſacred Revelations; Chriſt ſeals up the Ordinance by the dropping of the holy Unction. A Believer meets with ſuch illuminations as are far more precious than all the Lights in Nature. Hence St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>'s Auditors, when he was like to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, cried out, <hi>Satius eſt ut Sol non luceat, quam ut</hi> Chryſoſtomus <hi>non doceat; It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to loſe the Sun, than ſuch a burning ſhining light as he was. The entrance</hi> or opening <hi>of thy words giveth Light,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.130. When the Word preached is
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63874:199"/>admitted into the heart by Faith, and there opened by the Holy Spirit, a celeſtial Light riſes up, and bears Witneſs to the Ordinance. Again, in the midſt of <hi>plainneſs</hi> Divine <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> ſhews forth it ſelf; the Miniſter ſtands without, but the Word enters in and <hi>anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes</hi> the heart. <hi>Eliſha</hi> proved himſelf a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in telling <hi>what the King of</hi> Syria <hi>ſpake in his Bed-chamber.</hi> Our Saviour manifeſted his Deity in anſwering to the thoughts of Men. When the Word preached penetrates into the retiring-rooms and inmoſt chambers of the heart, and there rifles the very thoughts and unriddles the purpoſes and inclinations; It is an infallible Sign that the Great Searcher of hearts hath ſent a Beam of Omniſcience along with it. The Believer, who above all other men ſtudies himſelf moſt, deſires much to know two things, <hi>viz. What of ſecret ſin there is in him,</hi> and <hi>what of truth of Grace.</hi> And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſearching Ordinance he comes to ſee many a mote or black ſpot in his heart, ſuch as he never dream't of; and withal ſome marks and characters which to his comfort ſhew him his <hi>uprightneſs:</hi> and in ſuch Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he ſees the Great Revealer of Secrets co-operating with the Word. Moreover, whileſt the Miniſter is unfolding the Goſpel, ſuch are the raviſhing ſavours of Chriſt and Grace, as if a box of Heavenly Spikenard were broken in the Believers Heart: Pardon and Peace ſmell out of the odours of Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Heaven it ſelf out of his pure Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63874:200"/>Through this <hi>lattice</hi> (how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſoever it be to carnal Men) Chriſt ſhews his all-deſirable ſelf and full treaſures; Free-Grace communicates pardons and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens; the Divine Spirit breaths life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into Believers, quickning and awakening to anſwer the pure Commands with Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this and that Promiſe lets out its ſweetneſs, and flows as a Conduit of Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Wine, with admirable Suavities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. In ſuch things as theſe Faith hath ſweet Communion with God, and a ſure ſeal ſet to this Ordinance. In the Preaching of the Goſpel <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven comes nigh,</hi> even to <hi>rejecters,</hi> Luk. 10.11. Much more doth it do ſo unto <hi>Believers,</hi> who take the holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Promiſes into the boſom and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex of Faith, and thereby inflame their Hearts with the Love of Chriſt and Grace, as a ſure witneſs that this Ordinance which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo much of Heaven in it, is from thence.</p>
               <p>Next to the Preaching of the Word I ſhall ſet the Ordinance of Prayer: This is <hi>the aſcent of the Soul unto God as the fountain of all Good.</hi> As in every luſt there is a depreſſion of the Heart to one Creature or other; ſo in every right Prayer there is an holy elevation of it to God. This gives great Glory to God; as it is humble, it reveres his Majeſty; as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, it owns his Omniſcience; as believing, it glorifies his condeſcending Grace; and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, it overcomes the Almighty, and takes the Kingdom of Heaven by violence;
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63874:200"/>opening a door to that infinite maſs or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace which is laid up for thoſe that ſtrive and wreſtle with him for ſupplies out of it. This is a <hi>Catholick</hi> Duty, good in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>Jews</hi> prayed <hi>in or towards the Temple,</hi> but now the whole World is conſecrated for it; every where <hi>holy hands are to be lifted up;</hi> fit for all times, <hi>praying always,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. Not that we are to do nothing elſe, as the <hi>Euchitae</hi> or <hi>Meſſaliani</hi> of old drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but that there is no time wherein the Mercy-ſeat is ſhut, or Chriſt not interceding above, or the holy Spirit not ready in ſome meaſure to aſſiſt Believers: Neither is there any time in which we ſhould not carry about with us a virtual confeſſion in our ſenſe of Sin, or a virtual Prayer in our ſenſe of Wants, or a virtual Praiſe in our ſenſe of Mercies. <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum deſiderium eſt continua oratio,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath it. <hi>Vita hominis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther, nibil aliud eſt, niſi oratio, gemitus, deſiderium, ſuſpirium ad miſericordiam Dei; Mans life ſhould be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual breathing after God.</hi> And withal it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all Men; the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency probably addreſſed himſelf to God in Prayer; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was much in it; the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> by the light of Nature uſed it. It was an old <hi>Gentile-Law, Ad divos adeunto,</hi> go to the gods. <hi>Socrates</hi> prayed that he might be <hi>Intus pulcher, inwardly fair</hi> with virtue. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every one who</hi> is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos mentis,</hi> will <hi>in the beginning of any work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the gods.</hi> How much more muſt Chriſtians
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63874:201"/>pray, who have before their eyes a <hi>Goſpel,</hi> a <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and <hi>an open way into the Holy of Holies through the Veil of Chriſts fleſh!</hi> Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencrate perſons are bound to this Duty, as we ſee in the Command to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> being <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity, Act.</hi> 8.22; Much more Believers. Prayer is the breath of the new-creature, and badg of Chriſtians; who are thus deciphered by the Apoſtle, <hi>All that call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. Such and ſo great is this Ordinance, that the <hi>Jews</hi> (who prayed <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and therefore called Prayer <hi>Gnammuda,</hi> or <hi>Standing</hi>) uſed to ſay, <hi>Sine ſtationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus non ſtaret mundus, The world would not ſtand without Standing or Prayer.</hi> That this is an Ordinance of God, the Believer expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments many ways:</p>
               <p>Firſt, He experiments it <hi>in the Aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit;</hi> which is as Gales to the Sails of Prayer in its Voyage to Heaven; and as holy Fire to the Incenſe of it, cauſing it to aſcend to the Throne of Grace. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, Rom.</hi> 8.26. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It <hi>lifts over againſt us,</hi> or <hi>helps us to lift up a Prayer,</hi> which elſe would be too heavy for us. Whilſt the Believer is a-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O what heavenly meltings are there! The Believer is like <hi>Ephraim, bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> or as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Mizpeh, lamenting after the Lord,</hi> and <hi>pouring out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as if their eyes were turned into Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of penitential tears; or as the man in
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63874:201"/>the Goſpel, crying out with tears, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief;</hi> Catching at Mercy with an hand trembling at his own Infirmity. Such meltings and ſpiritual mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings over Sin, plainly ſhew, That the Spirit of Grace and Supplication is poured out upon the Prayer; making it, like the bruiſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, ſull of fragrancy, breathing out from a broken heart, diſſolved into tears by the beams of Gods Love. And in this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical thaw, What Divine enlargements are there! The heart is no longer in the Straits of Sin and Earth, but opened and expanded towards Heaven. E're the praying Believer is a ware, his Soul ſets him on the wheels, and his lips drop as the honey-comb; if not in the very entrance of the Duty, yet in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of it. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>38th</hi> Pſalm, ſeems cold and frozen in Unbelief; <hi>Gods arrows ſtick faſt in him, his hand preſſeth him ſore, the iniquities are too heavy, the wounds ſtink and are corrupt;</hi> There are nothing but bowings, breaches, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble roarings: But before he hath done pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his heart recovers again, <hi>In thee, O Lord, do I hope; thou wilt hear, O Lord my God,</hi> ver. 15. Sometimes at firſt there is a Cloud and dark Eclipſe upon the Prayer; and yet a little after, Grace breaks forth with its Sunny beams, and draws out the heart towards God, <hi>They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him and were lightned,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5; or as the words may be read, <hi>they looked unto him and flowed;</hi> their hearts were
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63874:202"/>as a River running out with ſpiritual fluency and enlargments; ſuch as are a real proof that the free Spirit is in the Prayer; and withal, What an heavenly ardor is there? <hi>While I was muſing the fire burned,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39.3. While the Believer is a-praying, the Holy Spirit is as fire upon the heart, inflaming it into religious aſcents towards God. The Believer ſtirs up himſelf, and takes hold on God by ſome Promiſe or other; and <hi>Jacob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> wreſtles with him for Mercy, and will not let him go till there be a dawn or day-break of Grace. He prays in his Prayer, and urges the Attributes of God upon him, and preſſes hard upon him with an holy <hi>immodeſty</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi> as the expreſſion is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.8; and will not be ſaid Nay. Much like <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> the pious Siſter of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who lay at the Altar with Tears and Prayers, and ſaid, That ſhe would not depart, till ſhe had her requeſt; and accordingly obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it of God. This is the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16, the <hi>inwrought Prayer,</hi> or Prayer wrought by Gods Spirit in ours, and from thence poured out in an agony, or vehemence of holy Aſſections, panting and breaking with longings after God and his Grace. <hi>Luther</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prayed with great fervency, ſaid, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam eodem ardore orare poſſem, Would to God I could always pray with the like ardor; then ſhould I always have this anſwer,</hi> Fiat quod velis, <hi>Be it unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> After this manuer doth the Holy Spirit come down on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63874:202"/>Prayer, and bear witneſs to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He experiments it <hi>in his Acceſs to God.</hi> The Devils, who are in Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can make no approaches to God; there is an unpaſſable gulf between them and him. It is ſtoried of a <hi>German Nobleman,</hi> that there was acted before him a Play of the five Wiſe and five Fooliſh Virgins; the Wiſe were St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> St. <hi>Catbarine,</hi> St. <hi>Barbara,</hi> St. <hi>Dorothy,</hi> St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> to theſe came the Fooliſh for Oyl; that is, as the Actor interpreted it, That they would intercede with God for their admiſſion into Heaven; They knocked, and wept, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly prayed, but the Wiſe denied, and bid them be gone: At this ſight the Nobleman was aſtoniſhed, crying out, <hi>What is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, if none of the Saints will hear and intercede for us?</hi> And ſoon after he died of an <hi>Apoplexy.</hi> 'Tis ſad being ſhut out from the preſence of God. The Believer is, as they ſay of the <hi>Rhodians, in ſole poſitus.</hi> He is nigh unto God, and hath his Religion proved to him, in that he hath <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the throne of Grace;</hi> and there utter all his mind, as a Child doth to his Father. <hi>David,</hi> in the <hi>13th Pſalm,</hi> begins as if God were totally abſent, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63874:203"/>thy face from me?</hi> But a little after we have him in the joy and triumph of Faith; <hi>I have truſted in thy mercy, my heart ſhall rejoice in thy ſalvation,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. The door of Mercy, which for a little time was ſhut up, ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened again, and gave him a free acceſs unto God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He experiments it <hi>in the returns of Prayer;</hi> the Promiſes, by which God binds his own bowels above, are let down here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Goſpel. And as the Believer takes hold of them by Prayer, ſo God is touched with a compaſſionate feeling thereof. Whilſt <hi>Ephraim</hi> was <hi>bemoaning himſelf</hi> in his Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Gods bowels are troubled and fall a-ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it,</hi> Jer. 31.18, 20. <hi>Coelum tundimus &amp; miſericordiam extorquemus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian; We knock at Heaven, and fetch down mercy from God.</hi> Prayer hath done Wonders in the world. At <hi>Abrahams</hi> Prayer. God ſtoops to ſuch low terms, that he would have ſaved <hi>Sodom</hi> for <hi>ten righteous perſons: Jacob</hi> by Prayer wreſtles, and becomes a <hi>Prince with God;</hi> which is more than to have all the Monarchies of the World. <hi>Moſes</hi> by it binds as it were the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will not <hi>let him alone</hi> to conſume <hi>Iſrael: Joſhua</hi> ſtopt the Chariot of the Sun, and ſo made a long day for the improvement of his Victory: <hi>Elias</hi> locked up Heaven, and till he turned the Key of Prayer the contrary way <hi>there was no rain upon the Earth.</hi> In the time of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> the Philoſopher, the <hi>Chriſtian Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> by their Prayers, procured Water for the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63874:203"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and a ſcattering Tempeſt againſt their Enemies; and were therefore called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio fulminatrix, The thundring Legion.</hi> Prayer hath a kind of Omnipotence in it, and can do every thing. Sometimes the Prayer is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Specie,</hi> in the very thing deſired, as <hi>Hannah</hi>'s was in a Son; whom therefore ſhe called <hi>Samuel;</hi> that is, Asked of God. In this caſe the Believer hath a double Bleſſing in one; over and above the common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he hath a pregnant proof of his Prayer in it. A Bleſſing, which is a meer Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, comes up, as the Corn doth, with the husk or chaff of one vanity or other, as a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> of that blaſt which Sin brought upon the World: But that, which is a Fruit of Prayer, is as Manna from Heaven, pure and unmixt; a Bleſſing and no ſorrow added to it; as being the Birth of the Promiſe and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Bleſſings of the former ſort are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by Men as Acorns are by Swine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking up to that Grace, which as a Tree of Life bears all the good Fruit: But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter raiſes up the Heart in the admirations and high-praiſes of the great Donor, as we ſee in <hi>Hannah,</hi> who returned back her Son, aſſoon as received, unto God in Praiſe and Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Criticks have obſerved an elegant <hi>Paranomaſia</hi> in thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>therefore I have lent him to the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Samuel</hi> was firſt <hi>Shaiil meel, Asked of God;</hi> and then <hi>Shaiil leel, lent or returned to God.</hi> Thoſe Bleſſings, which are drawn down by
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63874:204"/>Prayer, lie not dead here below, but are ſent back again in Praiſe. Sometimes the Prayer returns another way, though it be not heard <hi>ad voluntatem,</hi> it is <hi>ad utilitatem:</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is in ſome thing that profits us, though not to the expreſs deſire of our Hearts; it may be it is in the ſweet compoſure of the Heart. Upon Prayer God comes in, and rebukes the Winds and Seas of Paſſion, and there is a calm and Divine ſerenity in the Soul. <hi>Hannab</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayer was <hi>a Woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit;</hi> but her Soul being poured out unto God, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a Divine ſweetneſs; <hi>Her countenance was no more ſad,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. It may be there is an inward ſupport which is <hi>tantamount</hi> to the Bleſſing deſired. Our Saviours Prayer againſt the Cup of Wrath was heard, in that he was enabled to drink and overcome it. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s againſt the Thorn in the Fleſh, in that he had ſufficient Grace to withſtand it. <hi>Preclarè nobiſcum agitur, dum adeſt Dei Gratia quae nobis ſubveniat,</hi> ſaith Reverend <hi>Calvin.</hi> In the Supports of Grace there is a ſignal anſwer of Prayer; it may be, over and above the Support, the Beams of Gods Love break in upon the heart: This is a little Heaven here below, and richly tranſcends all this world. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us a Story of an old Man, who uſed to riſe from Duty with theſe words; <hi>Claudimini, Oculi mei, claudimini; nihil enim pulchrius jam videbitis: Be ſhut, O my Eyes, be ſhut; for I ſhall never behold a fairer Object than Gods Face, which I have now beheld.</hi> The
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63874:204"/>Love of God irradiating a Prayer is a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight, far better than life and all its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. It may be there is a tranſmutation of the Bleſſing into another; ſuch as God, who improves the ſtock of Prayer to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, knows to be better for us. <hi>David</hi> prayed earneſtly for his ſick Child, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of it was in a <hi>Solomon,</hi> a <hi>Jedidiah</hi> beloved of God. One way or other the Believers Prayer returns into his boſom, being anſwered at leaſt <hi>ſecundum cardinem, according to the main hinge</hi> and ſcope of it, which is Gods glory and Mans comfort or happineſs. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer to go into <hi>Canaan</hi> was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the ground of it. Inſtead of the type God takes him up to <hi>Heaven</hi> the <hi>true Canaan,</hi> which was moſt for <hi>Maſes</hi>'s comfort; And inſtead of <hi>Moſes a type of the Law, Joſhua a type of Chriſt</hi> leads the people into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was moſt for Gods Glory. Which way ſoever the Prayer returns to the Believer, it ſeals up the Ordinance for Divine.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Place I come to <hi>the Ordinance of the Lord Supper:</hi> The outward Elements of this Sacrament our Lord Chriſt took (as Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men conceive) from a cuſtom obſerved among the <hi>Jews</hi> at the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> at the end of the Celebration whereof, the Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was wont to take a Cake of Bread, and after the bleſſing thereof to break and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to the Communicants; and alſo after that a Cup of Wine in like ſort, unto which ſome refer that <hi>Cup of Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 116.13.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63874:205"/>The Bread and Wine among the <hi>Jews</hi> were but a Cuſtomary Rite, but Chriſt conſecrated them into a Sacrament; ſaying of the Bread, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and of the Wine, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> which could not before be ſaid of them. In the <hi>Paſchal Rite,</hi> it was only ſaid of the Bread, <hi>This is</hi>

                  <hi>the Cup of the Hymn:</hi> But now, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>this is my Blood.</hi> In this great Ordinance the Body and Blood of Chriſt are evidently figured out, and ſet forth before our eyes, as if he were Crucified among us. The <hi>ſeventh General Council</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who knocked down all other Images, ſaith of this Sacrament, That it is <hi>Vera Chriſti Imago,</hi> the <hi>only true Crucifix or Image of Chriſt.</hi> And which is much more than an Image, <hi>the very Body and Blood of Chriſt</hi> are here <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> though <hi>Spiritually</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our <hi>Faith,</hi> being exhibited <hi>ut epulum faederale,</hi> as a <hi>Covenant-feaſt,</hi> or Love-banquet, chearing the heart of God and Man. The ſame Body and Blood, which in the Sacrifice on the Croſs were a ſweet ſavour unto God, and ſatisfied his Juſtice, are ſet forth in the Sacrament as meat and drink for our Faith, feeding us to Life Eternal. Here is <hi>Epitome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelti,</hi> a compend of the Goſpel, the whole Covenant and Contrivance of Salvation is ſealed in a bit of Bread and drop of Wine: Here the Believer meets with many rich Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, he feeds and lives upon a Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63874:205"/>Chriſt, <hi>eating his Fleſh and drinking his Blood;</hi> and what a Feaſt is this! 'tis much that our Bodies may live upon the Body and Blood of Creatures; but Oh incomparable Grace! Our Souls may live on the Body and Blood of God. <hi>One drop whereof,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther, is more worth than Heaven and Earth.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctio convivalis,</hi> a <hi>Feaſtival <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which they uſed as a token of welcome to pour on the head of their Gueſts: Thus there came unto Chriſt a <hi>Woman having an Atabaſter box of very precious Ointment, and poured it on his head as he ſate at meat,</hi> Mat. 26.7. Whileſt we are at the Lords-Table, we are anointed with freſh Oyl; the holy Spirit is poured out in richer meaſures of Grace and Comfort, than it was at firſt. As a Spirit of Grace and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it melts the Heart into godly ſorrows at the ſight of a Cruciſied Chriſt: Sin being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> the betrayer and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the Son of God; the Nails in his Croſs, and Spear in his Side; the Gall and Wormwood in the Cup of Wrath which made him ſweat drops of Blood, and under an horrid Eclipſe of Gods favour to cry out of forſaking. To look upon a groaning World travelling under an univerſal vanity, would
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63874:206"/>ſtir up ſorrow in any that had a ſenſe of it; much more to look upon a Chriſt, a Creator bleeding and dying upon a Croſs; to the leaſt drop of whoſe Paſſion the daſhing down of a World is a poor inconſiderable nothing. To look upon the broken Tables of a Law dearer to God than Heaven and Earth is very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; but to ſtand and ſee God for our Sin bruiſing and breaking his own Son and Effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Image in our aſſumed Nature, is matter of amazing ſorrow. Never was Sin ſet forth. in ſuch bloody Colours as in his Paſſion; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do repentant tears flow more purely than at ſuch a ſpectacle. Here the Heart breaks in its cloſing with a broken Chriſt, and bleeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh over his Wounds, and turns <hi>the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper</hi> into <hi>a Baptiſm of Tears;</hi> and out of an holy hatred and revenge would have the violence done to Chriſt be put upon Sin the great Crucifier of him in the true Mortification thereof. As a Spirit of Faith it cauſes us to live upon Chriſt: Having no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of our own to anſwer the Law with, we feaſt and ſatisfie our ſelves in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt; as in that which ſatisfied the heart of God, and is here made over to ſatisfie ours. We may ſurely ſay, <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God is upon us;</hi> and as it hath no ſpot or wrinkle in it ſelf, ſo it leaves no ground of ſcruple or jealouſie in our Hearts in the midſt of our Sins, which have Death and Hell virtually in them. We yet live upon the ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice of Chriſt. His Blood which was
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63874:207"/>offered up to God through the Eternal Spirit, and by him accepted as a plenary Satisfaction for Sin, is now put into Promiſes and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as into ſo many Baſins, and from thence ſprinkled on our Conſcience to purge away all our guilt; our Sins are pardoned, and our Pardon paſſed under the Seal of Heaven. In the midſt of our Wants, Faith can triumph in the immenſe Treaſures of Grace in Chriſt ſet open in this Ordinance to all comers. Here's Eye-ſalve for our Blindneſs; Strength for our Weakneſs; Melting for the hard Heart; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials for Fainting-fits; quenching Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fiery darts of Satan; and Healing for the bloody iſſues of Sin. <hi>From this Table we go,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome, as Lions breathing fire terrible to the Devils themſelves. Ante faciem <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctionis Chriſti nullus omnino ſtare poteſt morbus animae, quamvis inveteratus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard; Before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of Chriſt the moſt inveterate diſeaſe of the Soul will vaniſh away.</hi> When once the <hi>Venetians</hi> were boaſting of their great Treaſures, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador told them, <hi>That his Maſters Treaſure had a root in the Mines of America.</hi> However worldly Men may boaſt of outward things, the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers joy is, That his Graces have a ſure root in the Mines and rich Treaſures of Chriſt; in whom dwells all fulneſs of abundance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundance running over in ſhares and meaſures upon all that are in him. As a ſpirit of Love it inflames the Heart towards Chriſt; Oh! what manner of Love is here ſet before us!
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63874:207"/>the Fathers own Son and Image, paſſing by Angels, aſſumed our frail Fleſh, and in it ſtood in our room: Having, though the Holy One, the Sin of the World caſt on him by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Imputation; and though the beloved Son, the Wrath of God bruiſing and preſſing him into a bloody Agony and Paſſion on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. The Fathers Eternal Joy and Splendor lay for a time in a dark Eclipſe of Sorrow and Deſertion, as one forſaken of God, that we might not be caſt out into utter darkneſs; and bled and died on a Croſs as one accurſed of God, to keep us from bleeding in eternal flames, and to purchaſe a place in Glory for us. And all this in outward Elements is not only <hi>limmed out and figured to our ſenſes, but ſealed to our hearts,</hi> as that which we have a real ſhare and intereſt in. And what attractives and inflammatives are here? Now, if ever, our Heart will breath out it ſelf in holy Raptures after Chriſt, and faint and ſwoon away in Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick deſires, till it can catch hold and embrace him, and ſo taſte the rare Delights and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies of an Union with Him: And the greater thoſe Complacencies are, the higher are the Deſires, and reciprocally the higher the Deſires, the greater the Complacencies; till at laſt the Believing Soul in rapes of Love breaks forth into <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> and <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> touching its great Redeemer. Such Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe prove this Ordinance to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>

               <p>Thus much touching the Ordinances in Scripture, and the Experimenting their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Place I ſhall mention <hi>The great Works of Power Recorded in Scripture:</hi> many of theſe are Types of the <hi>Magnalia</hi> or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Wonders wrought in or for the Souls of Men. Thus the <hi>Ark</hi> which ſaved from the Deluge was a Type of Salvation from Wrath in and through Chriſt; <hi>Iſaac,</hi> born of a dead Body and Womb, a Type of the New-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brought forth by ſupernatural Grace; and <hi>The bringing Iſrael out of Egypt,</hi> a Type of the great Redemption wrought by Chriſt. Theſe a Believer may Experiment in their Spiritual Imports and Myſteries, which are more great and glorious than the Things themſelves. Not to be prolix in this; I ſhall only inſtance in two Things, <hi>viz. The Creation of the World,</hi> Hiſtorically ſet forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and <hi>The Miracles wrought by Chriſt,</hi> related in the Goſpel. As touching <hi>Creation,</hi> as clear a Glaſs as it is of the Eternal Power and Godhead, the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> were much miſtaken about it: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſerting, <hi>That the World was Eternal;</hi> as if it were poſſible, That there ſhould be an infinite orderly Succeſſion of Things, or a third, fourth, fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without a firſt; or as if a World, a Creature, could be made as the Son of God was Begotten, or joyn Eternities with its Creator. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> dreaming at leaſt of an Eternal Matter or <hi>Chaos;</hi> as if that <hi>Axiome, ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> which runs true in Nature,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63874:208"/>did reach God himſelf; or as if He, like our Mechanicks on Earth, could not work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tools or Materials: Or, as if the Gulf between Nothing and Being were ſo great, that Infinite Power could not fill it up, and ſetch over a Creature from Nullity into Being. The <hi>Epicureans</hi> fancying the World to be made by a fortuitous concourſe of <hi>Atomes</hi> luckily meeting together in the framing of it; as if the blind Particles of Matter could range themſelves into a World full of delicate Order and Harmony; or as if the various parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motions, and orderly diſpoſitions in the great Univerſe could be but a <hi>chance;</hi> or as if the admirable conſent and confederation of all the parts therein, in which contraries conſpire and agree together for the good of the whole, were but a <hi>fortunate caſualty.</hi> Such were the dreams of the <hi>Sophi;</hi> but the Believer by Faith underſtands, <hi>That the Worlds were framed by the Word of God,</hi> Hebr. 11.3. And over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove may experience a Creation, a pretious New-creation in his own Heart; <hi>We are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. In this Creation Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power is as much laid out as in the Old; and the Products of it are much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the other. Spiritual Light excels Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and the Firmament of Faith the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward One. The Living Water within exceeds the great Ocean; and Chriſt in the Heart, the Sun in the Heavens. Graces are tranſcendent Creatures, and ſurpaſs even the Immortal
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63874:209"/>Soul, which yet outweighs a World. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may look upon his Holy Faith, Fear, Love, Joy, Hope and Patience, which make up the New-Creature; and ſay, All theſe were created out of Nothing, and called into Being, when they were not: Here is <hi>dextra excelſi, The right hand of the moſt High,</hi> the very ſame which made the World, and <hi>Veſtigia Spiritûs Sancti, The footſteps</hi> of that Holy Spirit which of old moved on the Face of the Waters: Now I know, That God is a Creator indeed, and have a practical proof of it in my own Heart; every part of the New-creature bearing witneſs thereunto. As to <hi>the Miracles of Chriſt</hi> related in the Goſpel, theſe were ſo famous, That <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions them; <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in their Writings againſt Chriſtians durſt not deny them;<note place="margin">Grot. de Ver.

For the right underſtanding of theſe we muſt note; Chriſt did not come only or chiefly to cure the Bodies of Men, no, thoſe Miracles,

                  </gap>, thoſe <hi>Spiritual Miracles</hi> on the Souls of Men, which are incomparably <hi>greater</hi> than thoſe on their Bodies. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>blind Hearts</hi> (and thoſe worſe than blind Eyes) hath he cured by a Touch, as he paſſed by them in the Ordinances, cauſing them to ſee himſelf, the True light and Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, together with all the Heavenly My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries which ſtream as ſo many Beams or Rayes from him? How many <hi>deaf Souls</hi> have upon his Divine <hi>Ephatha</hi> been obedientially opened to the Commands of God; and though <hi>lame</hi> before, have <hi>Roſe up, walked holily, and praiſed God?</hi> what <hi>Spiritual Lepers</hi> hath he by a Touch of his Spirit and Word cleanſed? <hi>Quae enim immunditia, quae incredulitas, quae duritia, quod peccatum ad hunc contactum Chriſti conſiſtere poterit?</hi> ſaith <hi>Ferus; No uncleanneſs, unbelief, hardneſs, ſinfulneſs can ſtand againſt the Touch of Chriſt.</hi> What Sinners of all forts <hi>dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes</hi> hath he raiſed up to a Divine Life? Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> reciting that Chriſt had raiſed up three Perſons, <hi>viz. The Maid in her Fathers Houſe; the Young-Man carried out upon the Bier, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>four days dead and ſtinking in the Grave;</hi> adds, <hi>Iſta tria genera mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum ſunt tria genera peccatorum quos ſuſcitat
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63874:210"/>Chriſtus;</hi> theſe <hi>three dead ones are three ſorts of Sinners raiſed up by Chriſt.</hi> As the Maid in the houſe, ſo is the ſecret Sinner raiſed up <hi>intra la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebras conſcientiae,</hi> within the doors of his own Heart. As the young Man carried out upon the Bier, ſo is the open Sinner raiſed up out of known Sins: And as <hi>Lazarus dead and ſtinking in the grave,</hi> ſo is the cuſtomary Sinner raiſed up out of his old putrified Sins. At the voice of Chriſt the ſtrongeſt bonds of cuſtom are broken, and the poor Sinner comes forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an holy life. Theſe things being ſo, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That the Believer may experiment the Spiritual Miracles of Chriſt; and from thence gather a proof in his own Heart, That the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame hand wrought the Corporal ones; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing theſe latter are but types and ſhadows of the other, which he finds verified in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching this Fundamental Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the Scriptures: <hi>A Believer may experiment the Laws, Promiſes, Threatnings, Supernatural Truths, Sacred Ordinances, and Great Works in Scripture to be Divine, and ſo have a Practical proof that the Scripture is of God.</hi>

               <p>HAving paſſed over the Believers Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment touching the Scripture; I ſhall now proceed to another touching his own Eſtate. He may certainly know, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſpeaks, That it is well with him, That he is in a good ſtate of Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This is <hi>apex fidei,</hi> the <hi>top and higheſt ſtature of Faith;</hi> a Priviledg which tranſcends Earth, and antedates Heaven to us. Here are thoſe three things, <hi>Lumen, Laetitia, &amp; Pax, Light, Joy, and Peace,</hi> which (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Halenſis</hi> ſaith) <hi>render the experiment of Grace in the Soul truly certain.</hi> Here are Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Beams, unſpeakable Joys, admirable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renities, Sabbaths of Reſt, Seas of Sweetneſs, and Beatitudes too great for the tongue of Men and Angels to expreſs. Before the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever walked only with the ſingle <hi>ſtaff</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency and Reſignation; but now he hath <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>troops</hi> of Comfort following after him from the Promiſes: His <hi>darling Soul</hi> is now richly provided for to all Eternity; Eternal Beanty is in his Eye, Infinite Goodneſs at hand
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:63874:211"/>for his Embraces; the lines are fallen in a kind of Paradiſe; his Portion is no leſs than God himſelf; all his Bleſſings are dipt in Love: The World may brand him, but <hi>the Spirit ſeals;</hi> In the midſt of ſweeping Judgments he is ſtill one of <hi>Gods Jewels;</hi> and as ſoon as Death diſſolves him, Heaven receives him.</p>
               <p>Touching this great Experiment, I ſhall firſt prove, <hi>That it is attainable by a Believer;</hi> and then ſhew <hi>in what ways it is to be attained.</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> hold, That no Man without ſpecial Revelation can be certain of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation; not with a certainty of Faith,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Juſlif. lib. 3.</note> which is infallible, but only with a certainty of Hope which is conjectural. The Promiſes indeed are ſure, ſay they, but our Diſpoſitions are uncertain: The Promiſes run Conditionally, <hi>If they return to thee with all their heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 6.38. and who can be ſure that he doth ſo? <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean?</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19.12. Some Scriptures put a perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon Remiſſion, <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent?</hi> Jon. 3.9. <hi>Repent, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> Act. 8.22. And the reaſon is, becauſe of the uncertainty of our Diſpoſitions: Faith is not Faith unleſs it lean on the Divine Word; and no Word ſaith, Such or ſuch an one hath true Faith and Repentance, or is truly pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Happy is the man that feareth always,</hi> Prov. 28.14. <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above all

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:63874:212"/>of Men a-fluctuating in perpetual doubts and labyrinths. But let us ſee what they ſay for it, firſt diſtinguiſhing between the certainty of Faith, and the certainty of Hope; they allow the latter to Believers: And what manner of Hope is this? Is it a fallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Hope only? ſuch a <hi>Spiders web</hi> may be found in an Hypocrite, who hath no lot or part in this matter: Or is it a true Divine Hope ſutable to a real Believer? This even the School-man <hi>Durandus</hi> will confeſs to be ſuch, That <hi>non poteſt non evenire,</hi> it <hi>cannot but come to paſs, this will not make aſhamed,</hi> Rom. 5.5. by diſappointing the Soul where it lodgeth.

He doth as it were but <hi>Tantalize</hi> at the pure fountain of Joy and Conſolation. It's true, the Promiſes are Conditional; But are not thoſe Conditions found in true Believers? May they not know that they turn unto God with all their heart, that is, ſeriouſly and ſincerely? Remiſſion and Salvation hang not on the degree of Faith and Repentance; but on the truth thereof: They cannot ſay, their Heart is clean with a ſinleſs Sanctity; but they may, that it is ſo with a true Integrity, ſuch as hath all the Promiſes entailed on it.

The heart of man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,</hi> even the Believer's, ſo far as it is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with the reliques of Sin; but as it is renewed with Principles of Grace, it is <hi>a true heart,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. and ſo may paſs a true judgment on its own eſtate: Though it cannot know all that is in its own <hi>abyſs,</hi> yet it may know the general frame and byas of it ſelf; and thereby diſcover its Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. If natural Conſcience be <hi>a thouſand witneſſes,</hi> inlightned is <hi>ten thouſand.</hi> Faith (ſay the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) leans on the Word; and there is no Word That ſuch or ſuch an one hath true Faith and Repentance, or that his ſins are pardoned and remitted: Unto which I anſwer, As to that, That no Word ſaith, that ſuch an one hath true Faith and Repentance; it is to be conſidered, That when one Propoſition ſtands upon the Word, and another upon natural light or experience; The Concluſion is <hi>de Fide.</hi> When in the 6. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council</hi> the Fathers proceeded againſt the <hi>Monothelites</hi> by this Argument:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever is true God and true Man bath two Wills: But Chriſt is true God and true Man; Ergo he hath two Wills.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> ſtood on the Light of Nature, and the <hi>Minor</hi> only on the Word; yet the Concluſion was <hi>de Fide.</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:63874:213"/>And when the Believer thus communes with his own heart in a practical Syllogiſm:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever believs and repents bath his Sins pardoned: But I believe and repent; Ergo I have my Sins pardoned.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> ſtands on the Word, and the <hi>Minor</hi> on Experience; but the Concluſion is <hi>de Fide.</hi> If a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion drawn from two Propoſitions, one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Word, and another on other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, be not <hi>de Fide,</hi> What will the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> do for their darling <hi>the Popes Supremacy?</hi> To prove that ſuch or ſuch a Pope, ſuppoſe <hi>Gregory</hi> or <hi>Innocent</hi> were Supream in the Church, They muſt argue thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoever is</hi> Peters <hi>Succeſſor is Supream in the Church; But</hi> Gregory <hi>or</hi> Innocent <hi>were</hi> Peters <hi>Succeſſors:</hi> Ergo, <hi>They were Supream in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which Argument, though they would fain ſet up the <hi>Major</hi> upon Scripture, yet the <hi>Minor</hi> ſtands only on Election. No Scripture ſaith, That <hi>Peters Succeſſor</hi> muſt be a <hi>Gregory</hi> or an <hi>Innocent;</hi> nevertheleſs they would have the Concluſion <hi>de fide.</hi> But if a Concluſion drawn from ſuch Propoſitions be <hi>de fide,</hi> then may the Believer, according to the practical Syllogiſm abovementioned, conclude in Faith, That his ſins are pardoned, though no Word tell him, That he hath true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It ſuffices, that Experience tells him ſo. But as a further anſwer: Neither is the Word altogether wanting herein; for it ſets out Faith and Repentance by infallible marks
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63874:214"/>and characters, as common touchſtones to try them by to the end of the World: And where thoſe marks and characters are, it pronounces thoſe Graces to be of the right ſtamp, and virtually tells Believers as much; and they being irradiated with the Holy Spirit, which ſhines upon both Scriptures and Evidences, may receive the ſaying, and conſidently ſay, as St. <hi>John</hi> doth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>We know that we know him.</hi> This is the Faith, and this the Repentance marked out in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Again, as to that, That no Word ſaith, That ſuch or ſuch an one in particular hath his ſins pardoned. The anſwer is eaſie, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals include Particulars: That 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God,</hi> condemns the <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> as much as if they had been named. That 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, <hi>forbidding to marry,</hi> condemns the <hi>Euſtathians</hi> as much as if they had been named. That Threatning, <hi>Curſed is every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all things,</hi> being general, ſpeaks Wrath to every Tranſgreſſor as ſoon as he is ſuch. And ſo that Promiſe, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> being general, ſpeaks Pardon and Salvation to every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as ſoon as he is ſuch; <hi>All that believe are juſtified, Act.</hi> 13.39. No ſooner doth this or that man believe, but the Promiſe ſpeaks to him, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee;</hi> God ſaith to him, <hi>I am thy ſalvation.</hi> It may be he doth not underſtand it at firſt: However here is a
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63874:214"/>ſure ground-work for him to believe that it is ſo; and ſo accordingly he doth, as ſoon as Aſſurance comes in to him.</p>
               <p>Moreover the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> urge, That the Doctrine of Aſſurance puffs up Pride, and opens a gap to Licentiouſneſs. Unto which my anſwer is a flat Denial: If our Saviour had thought, that Aſſurance would make men like Devils in Pride, or Beaſts in Licentiouſneſs, he would never have ſaid, as he did to the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick, <hi>Thy ſins be forgiven thee, Mat.</hi> 9.2. Had they told us, That ſuch a Worm as Pride would breed out of the Doctrines of Merit and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatory Works, it might eaſily have been believed; but that it ſhould drop from ſuch an Honeycomb of Free-Grace, as the Doctrine of Aſſurance is, is not reaſonably to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Here's nothing of Merit, nothing of our own, all is pure meer Grace; the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Faith and Repentance is of Grace, and the Aſſurance of Pardon and Salvation is Grace upon Grace, Sealing-Grace upon Sanctifying: And whatever perverſe abuſe may be made of theſe, the natural tendency thereof is not to Pride; for a man after ſuch Graces to forget the great Fountain, and ſet up an Idol of Self-excellency, is extreamly unreaſonable. Juſt as if he ſhould ſay, Now I am in the boſom of Grace, but I would be caſt out, and be held afar off; Now I have the warm Beams of Gods Favour, but I would fain be in the Dark again; Who would argue thus? Will it not be much more proper, in an humble admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63874:215"/>to ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Who am I? and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. Thy Love, O God, firſt made me a Veſſel of Faith, and then filled me with the Oyl of Holy Joy; What am I to be ſuch a Receiver? All that I am is too ſmall a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; nothing of ſelf may remain for an Idol. Had they ſaid, That Licentiouſneſs might have been fathered on the Sale of Pardons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, it had been veryright; Theſe made <hi>Germany</hi> and other parts groan with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſs: But to lay it at the door of Aſſurance, is abominable. <hi>Machiavel</hi> was out in his Politicks, when he would have Princes Rule by Fear; but he adviſed ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew well enough, That following his Rules they could not be Loved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would perſwade them, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be feared. The true Obedience (for I look not on that which a man is haled unto as ſuch) ſprings out of <hi>Love,</hi> for <hi>that fulfils the Law;</hi> and our Love ſprings out of Gods, for <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4.19. And the more his Love is revealed, the more ours is inflamed towards Obedience. In Heaven the bleſſed Angels, who ſee Gods Face in Glory, are moſt intent upon the doing of his Will; on Earth holy men, who taſte of his favour, walk the more accurately for it. The joyful ſound of Pardon being in the Conſcience makes the holy Walk eaſie, and a fair proſpect of Heaven, ſweetens every ſtep. Obedience ſtands no-where ſo ſure as in the Circle of Love, which
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63874:215"/>from Gods Love, as the firſt Point, is drawn through ours round about into it ſelf. Gods Love coming down in Aſſurance, and ours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in Obedience; his being inflammative to ours, and ours reſignative to him: in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of Love their is no room for Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs. It's true Saints after ſuch <hi>Pleonaſmes</hi> of Love may fall foully; but do they fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe aſſured? Do they turn Enemies to God, becauſe they know themſelves Friends? Can the Light of Gods Countenance diſpoſe them to Works of Darkneſs? May the choice In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Heaven make them earthly and ſenſual? Will the Prodigal once returned, run away the ſooner from his Fathers Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Kiſs,</hi> and <hi>Robe,</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> and Fatted Calf freely beſtowed upon him? Such things as theſe do involve many Paradoxes and Repugnancies in them; and withal caſt dirt upon Heaven, and blaſpheme the Witneſſing Spirit: and therefore are juſtly abominable to the Saints, who experience the contrary in their own Hearts.</p>
               <p>Having thus far gone through the Enemies Camp, I come now to lay down my <hi>Theſis</hi> to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Believer may be certainly and infallibly aſſured of his Pardon and Salvation; I ſay a Believer may be aſſured: an Unbeliever while ſuch is not a ſubject capable of Aſſurance; he hath Plague-Sores and Tokens of Wrath upon him, but as yet never a Beam of Grace or Love: the Juſtice and Holineſs of God cannot ſuffer him
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63874:216"/>to be ſhined on; none of the Promiſes can ſpeak kindly or comfortably to him; his ſtony Heart cannot receive the Seal and Impreſs of the Holy Spirit. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>After ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. after, and not before. Firſt, there muſt be <hi>a new Creature,</hi> and then <hi>a new Name.</hi> Firſt, Gods Image is printed on the Heart, and then his Love. I ſay, a Believer may be aſſured, but not that all Believers are ſo. A man may be a Babe in Chriſt and not know it: a <hi>Child of Light,</hi> and yet <hi>walking in darkneſs.</hi> A Believer may live <hi>in crepuſculo,</hi> in the twilight or mixt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hope and Fear; and ſo, though ſure of Heaven, not in his own ſenſe aſſured of it: I mean not that he may be aſſured by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Voice from Heaven or extraordinary Revelation: This the Adverſaries will admit, but in an ordinary way, in the diligent uſe of ſuch Helps and Means as are common to all Believers. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaks in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all, <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe; that ye may know that ye have eternal Life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. He doth not ſay, ſome may know it in an extraordinary way, but ſpeaks of it as knowable by Believers in common: I mean not that he hath this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance always or in every point of time; <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Serenity is not here below:</hi> Earth is not as Heaven; the Sun may be eclipſed, the Seal of the Spirit may be clouded, Evidences may be blurred and hardly legible: It may be God
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:63874:216"/>in Sovereignty withdraws, or Satan in envy buffets, or the Believer lets down his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Watch, or a due eſtimate is not ſet on Heavenly Comforts, or there is ſome great Trauſgreſſion, which as <hi>an accurſed thing, cauſes the Lord to depart.</hi> In ſuch caſes, though there be no interciſion of Juſtification, yet there is an interruption of Conſolation. Theſe Things premiſed, I proceed to prove the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Believer may attain Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Pardon and Salvation.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place the Names and Titles given unto Faith in Scripture are remarkable. 'Tis called <gap reason="foreign">

As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, We are indeed in the very Borders of Heaven, and we know it as it were ſenſibly, as we do our paſſage from one Place to another. 'Tis ſet out by <gap reason="foreign">

It is well obſerved by the acute Dr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſmith,</hi> That in Scripture mention is made of a triple <hi>Plerophory,</hi> a <hi>Plerophory of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> Col. 2.2. a <hi>Plerophory of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. and a <hi>Plerophory of Hope,</hi> Heb. 6.11. The <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of each ſhews forth it ſelf in the Believers Practical Syllogiſm:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved;</l>
                  <l>But I believe:</l>

               <p>Ergo, <hi>I ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Major</hi> we have a <hi>Plerophory of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg:</hi> In the <hi>Minor</hi> a <hi>Plerophory of Faith;</hi> And in the Concluſion flowing from the Premiſes, a <hi>Plerophory of Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place ſome Commands in the Goſpel clearly import that Aſſurance is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; there God would have us <hi>To work out our Salvation,</hi> Phil. 2.12. <hi>To make our calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>To add to our
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:63874:217"/>Faith virtue,</hi> one Grace upon another, and one degree of Grace upon another, <hi>That we may have an abundant entrance into the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>To walk by the Rule of the New Creature, that peace may be upon us,</hi> Galat. 6.16. <hi>To prove our own ſtate, whether we be in the Faith, whether Chriſt be in us or not,</hi> 2 Corinth. 13.5. <hi>To prove our own work, that we may have rejoycing in our ſelves, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6.4. If theſe things may be done Aſſurance is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; if they cannot, to what purpoſe are theſe Precepts? how vain and impoſſible are they? In that queſtion, Whether we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfil the Moral Law; the <hi>Pontificians</hi> urge thus for the Affirmative; If we cannot fulfil it, the Law is impoſſible and void,<note place="margin">De Juſtif. lib. 4. cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Si praecepta eſſent impoſſibilia, neminem obligarent, ac per hoc praecepta non eſſent praecepta,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, If the Commands were impoſſible, they would oblige none, and ſo would become no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> But in the Point of Aſſurance we may with much better reaſon ſay, if we cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Commands concerning it, they are then impoſſible and vain; the Law is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Rule of Righteouſneſs, a Copy of the pure Law engraven on Mans Heart at firſt, in the ſtate of Innecency, unto which it was attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated. It was not at all impoſſible, and that it is ſo now is only from Mans Apoſtacy: And withal, the very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the Law</hi> is admirably uſeful to drive us in a deep ſence of our Impotence, to
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63874:218"/>Chriſt the Complement of it, that through his holy Spirit we may in a way of ſincere though imperfect Obedience at laſt arrive at perfect Sanctity in Heaven. But if ſuch Commands as are purely Evangelical be impoſſible, what can be ſaid to it? what tolerable anſwer made? Were theſe at all accommodated to a ſtate of Innocency? Was not their Original ſcope to raiſe up fallen Man to Salvation? If the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of believing and repenting were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, what room would there be for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? And if the Commands of proving and enſuring our ſtate of Grace be impoſſible, what room is left for the Joys of Faith, or the Sealings of the holy Spirit, or the Suavities of a good Conſcience? And there being no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chriſt or Goſpel to fly to, whither doth this Impoſſibility drive but into the black gulf of Deſpair? Wherefore, as we would avoid ſuch doleful conſequences, we muſt conclude thoſe Precepts practicable, and ſo Aſſurance poſſible: And as a ſure ſeal thereof we have the ſweet experience of Saints in all Ages. Holy <hi>Job,</hi> though God multiplied his Wounds, and his Friends raked in them by a very ſharp charge of Hypocriſie, knew his own Integrity, and would not let it go, <hi>Job</hi> 27.5. And which reacheth beyond his preſent ſtate of Grace, as ſure of future Glory, he breaks out, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth;</hi> and maugre all the deſtructive worms, <hi>In my fleſh and with theſe very eyes I ſhall ſee God,</hi> Job 19.25, 26. O how certain was his Faith! <hi>I know;</hi> How appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative?
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:63874:218"/>
                  <hi>My Redeemer liveth;</hi> and how ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted? he could look through the duſt to Immortality. <hi>David</hi> knew the truth of his Grace, and proved it to himſelf by infallible Marks; <hi>I have kept the ways of the Lord, I have not wickedly departed from my God; I did not put away his ſtatutes from me, I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 18.21, 22, <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> And for future Happineſs, he ſaith without ſcruple, That at his waking in the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>he ſhould be ſatisfied with Gods likeneſs,</hi> Pſal. 17.15. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks as one full ſure of his preſent ſtate and future hope, <hi>I have fought a good ſight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. The Martyr <hi>Agatha,</hi> having her Breaſts cruelly cut off for Religion, told the Perſecutor, <hi>That yet ſhe had two Breaſts remaining, ſuch as he could not touch, the one of Faith, and the other of Hope;</hi> which afforded her great Comfort in her Torments. <hi>Caſpar Olevian</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Divine, being asked by one, Whether he were certain of his Salvation? anſwered juſt at the brink of death, <hi>Certiſſimus, I am moſt ſure of it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> being near death expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus, <hi>My whole heart is filled with joy, I feel nothing within but Chriſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> ſaid, <hi>His Soul was full of joy, as if be had ſeen Heaven open to receive him.</hi> Such Paradiſes of Joy, Sabbatiſines of Spirit, and Prepoſſeſſions of Glory have the Saints found in their way to Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:63874:219"/>
               <p>Again, there being an infallible Connexion between truth of Grace and Pardon, and alſo between Perſeverance in Grace and Salvation, a Believer may be aſſured of the truth of his Graces, and ſo of his Pardon; and again he may be aſſured of his Perſeverance in Grace, and ſo of his Salvation: Theſe two demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated will make good the Point. Firſt I ſay, <hi>A Believer may be aſſured of the truth of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo of his Pardon,</hi> which cannot but be where thoſe are. And for the truth of Grace a double Teſtimony may be vouched, one <hi>from Conſcience,</hi> the other <hi>from the holy Spirit;</hi> the Apoſtle mentions both; <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſs with our ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>it co-witneſſeth with ours,</hi> and in the mouth of two ſuch Witneſſes there muſt needs be eſtabliſhment: Hence St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on theſe words breaks out, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? <hi>What ſcruple can remain after ſuch a Teſtimony?</hi> I ſhall begin with <hi>the teſtimony of Conſcience.</hi> Conſcience is a ſpy in our boſom, which marks every thing; a ſpiritual <hi>Eccho,</hi> which returns our actions, and makes them ſound again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are paſt and gone from us: By it the Soul turns its eyes in ward, and becomes a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> or Looking-glaſs to it ſelf, repreſenting to it ſelf its own acts: By it it bends back the beams of general Truths, and applys them to Particulars. That Righteouſneſs and Virtue ſhould be followed is an univerſal Truth, but Conſcience can reflect it back upon us and bids us do ſo in particular; and if we indeed do it,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63874:219"/>Conſcience will ſay <hi>Euge,</hi> this or that is well done by us. The Teſtimony of Conſcience was of great repute among <hi>Pagans; Plato</hi> calls it his <hi>Daemon,</hi> and <hi>Menander a God,</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nemo in ſeſe tentat deſcendere, nemo, few or none would deſcend into themſelves.</hi> Among Chriſtians the Teſtimony of Conſeience muſt needs be ſacred; their Conſciences not lying, as the Pagans, in their blood or natural pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but being purified by the precious Blood and Spirit of Chriſt; their lamps of Reaſon not lying as the others in the damp and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fall, but brought forth and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at the Scripture, and Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhining therein as in its orb. Conſcience in a Believer is, as St.<hi>Bernard</hi> hath it, <hi>Purum Religionis ſpeculum,</hi> a <hi>pure glaſs of Religion:</hi> And as another, <hi>Major pars clavium, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt key in the Church;</hi> ſuch an excellent Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may well ſpeak in this Point. In <hi>David</hi> it ſpeaks thus, <hi>O Lord, I have walked in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi> Pſal. 26.1. that is, in the exerciſe of Faith, Love, Obedience, and other Graces, which as ſo many Pearls make up Sincerity. In <hi>Hezekiah</hi> it ſpeaks much after the ſame manner,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63874:220"/>
                  <hi>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> Iſa. 38.3. And it is the more to be noted, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſaith ſo in a way of appeal even to God himſelf; and by a right <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, holds up the truth of its Graces to ſo pure a Sun. This is ſuch a Teſtimony as St. <hi>Paul</hi> joys and glories in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Eſt quidam modus in Conſcientia gloriandi, ut noveris fidem tuam eſſe ſinceram, ſpem tuam certam, caritatem tuam ſine ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> ſaith St: <hi>Auſtin;</hi> There <hi>is a kind of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conſcience, when thou knoweſt thy Faith ſound, Hope certain, and Love undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi> A Man that repents, believes and loves, may by the pulſe of Conſcience, know that he doth ſo. True, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he may know that he doth them, but not that he doth them <hi>ſicut oportet,</hi> as he ought to do them. Unto which I anſwer; Conſcience according to its Light and Line of Principles can bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Integrity; natural Conſcience to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Integrity, and renewed Conſcience to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Integrity. An inſtance of the former we have in <hi>Abimelech,</hi> whoſe Conſcience told him, That he meant not to take away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Wiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.5. and of the latter in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe Conſcience told him, That his Converſation was <hi>in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Conſcience, which Witneſſes Integrity, muſt look beyond the meer matter of Acts into the <hi>modus;</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Integrity,eſpecially ſuch as is gracious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more than in the Acts themſelves. Unleſs
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:63874:220"/>a man know that he repents, believes, and loves <hi>ſicut oportet,</hi> he cannot know his own Sincerity; and if he know his Sincerity, he knows that he repents, believes, and loves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, A Believer converſes much between Scripture and Conſcience, fetching his Notions from the one, and his Evidences from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the Word he ſees the Characters of Grace, and in the Conſcience the ſtate of his Soul. <hi>True Repentance</hi> mourns over ſin as ſin, hates it as the greateſt evil, and caſts it away as an accurſed thing, <hi>ſaith the Word;</hi> and ſuch is thy Repentance, <hi>ſaith Conſcience. True Faith</hi> prizes Chriſt, overcomes the World and works by Love, <hi>ſaith the Word;</hi> and ſuch a Faith is thine, <hi>ſaith Conſcience. True Love</hi> is inflamed from Gods, ſweetly acquieſces in him, and obedientially reſignes to him, <hi>ſaith the Word;</hi> and ſuch a Love is thine, <hi>ſaith Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Interroga cortuum, Ask thy heart,</hi> If Love be there, <hi>ſaith St. Auſtin:</hi> Ask again, If Faith and Repentance be there, thou haſt an Oracle within, that can tell thee, what thou loveſt moſt, truſteſt in moſt, and grieveſt for moſt; that can ſhew thee thy Uprightneſs, witneſs the Truth of thy Graces, and feaſt thee with Divine Comforts, ſuch as paſs underſtanding. It was a great Comfort to the Nobleman, when his Servants met him, and told him, <hi>Thy Son liveth, John</hi> 4.51. But oh! What is it to the Believer when ſuch an one as Conſcience comes and ſaith, Thy Faith liveth, or thy Love burneth towards
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:63874:221"/>God, or thy Repentance is pure godly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Then the Oyl of Joy is upon every Grace, and the Cup of Conſolations runneth over: Conſcience becomes a banquetting-houſe, and Aſſurance, as <hi>Latimer calls it,</hi> is the Sweet-meats. We have heard one Witneſs, but the Supream, who drops all the Suavities, and dictates all the comfortable words in conſcience is the Holy Spirit: <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not the Gifts or Graces, but the very Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs; &amp; that not only out wardly in the Word, but in wardly <hi>in and with our ſpirit;</hi> and its Teſtimony is <hi>That we are the children of God:</hi> And the import of that Teſtimony, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above the title of Sonſhip, is, That our Faith, <hi>which makes us his children, Gal.</hi> 3.26, is true; and our Love and other Graces, which manifeſt us ſuch, are ſo alſo. And what a Teſtimony is this? To call it dubious, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionative, or conjectural is blaſphemy. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius a Lapide,</hi> as one under a neceſſity, confeſſes this Teſtimony certain in it ſelf; but as a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Doctrine of doubting, adds, <hi>That it is not certain to us.</hi> But this is to forget the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words, <hi>That the Spirit witneſſeth it in and with our ſpirit;</hi> and withal abſurdly to ſay, That the Spirit indeed witneſſeth, but would not be believed; or rather, That it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, and witneſſeth not, becauſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard Teſtimony is as none. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Spirit witneſſeth not by an expreſs word, but
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63874:221"/>by an Experiment of internal peace and ſuavity, which begets but a conjectural certainty.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It's true, that it is not by an expreſs word; but, as Learned Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> well obſerves, The Queſtion is not <hi>de modo Teſtandi,</hi> but <hi>de Re.</hi> It is certain, there is ſuch a Teſtimony, and that proceeding from the Spirit of Truth muſt be infallible; and being made to our ſpirit muſt be known to us, and ſo beget a true certainty in our hearts. Nevertheleſs, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this Point, I ſhall a little conſider the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> of it: <hi>The Spirit bears witneſs to ours,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>by an application of the Promiſes to the heart,</hi> partly <hi>by an irradiation of the Graces there:</hi> Theſe two make up the ſealing of the Spirit of Promiſe given after believing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit applies the Promiſes to the Heart,</hi> that is, one part of the Seal. As the ſpirit of <hi>bondage</hi> applies threatnings, and thereby makes a kind of Hell in Conſcience, ſo the Spirit of <hi>Adoption</hi> applies Promiſes, and by it makes a kind of Heaven there. The ſame Spirit, which endited the Promiſes of Pardon, and put them into Scripture; Seals and in a way of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation puts them upon the Heart; as if it ſhould ſay; This and that Promiſe is thine; like that in the Prophet, <hi>Speak to her heart, that her iniquity is pardoned, Iſa.</hi> 40.2. Now, when the Promiſes come ſo cloſe and pour out their ſweetneſs into the heart, the Believer may not gueſs only, but know, that true Faith and Repentance are there. God and his Promiſe ſpeak peace only to Saints, and not a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:63874:222"/>Word to impenitent ſinners. I have read of one, who apoſtatized from his profeſſion, and on his ſick-bed began to apply the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to himſelf; but alas! after a little ſeeming eaſe, he cried out in deſpair, <hi>That the Plaiſter would not ſtick.</hi> God only can make it do ſo; and he makes it do ſo only to penitent Believers; and they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Truth of their Graces, when the Goſpel and its Promiſes come to them <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt and in much Aſſurance,</hi> as the Expreſſion is, 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>Again, as another part of he Seal, <hi>The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit irradiates the Graces in the Heart:</hi> The ſame Spirit which formed them there at firſt, comes and owns them as its own off-ſpring, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a Divine light, and making ſuch an efficacious repreſentation thereof, that the Believers Conſcience may, as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in another caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, <hi>Bear witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſay, This is ſound Repentance indeed, and that is Love undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the other is Faith unfeigned; and ſo of other Graces in the new Creature. Theſe Graces carry in themſelves a kind of heavenly light rendring them viſible: But when the Spirit comes, it puts ſuch a gloſs and oriency on them, that the Believer may know them to be freely given to him of God, that this and that Grace are ſo given, and ſuch and ſuch are the ſure marks of the truth thereof. Such a Teſtimony as this, made learned <hi>Rivet</hi> at his dying hour break forth into theſe words,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63874:222"/>
                  <hi>Expecto, credo, perſevero, dimoveri nequeo, Dei Spiritus meo ſpiritui teſtatur me eſſe ex filiis ſuis; O amorem ineffabilem! I expect, believe, perſevere, and cannot be moved, Gods Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth to mine, That I am one of his Children; Oh ineffable Love!</hi> This <hi>anointing</hi> is <hi>truth</hi> and no <hi>lye,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. It manifeſts its teſtimony and it ſelf together. The Believer cannot doubt who the Witneſs is, or what he ſpeaketh; both are plain and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. Our Saviour Chriſt, ſpeaking of the Spirit of Truth, tells his Diſciples, <hi>Ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, Joh.</hi> 14.17. If the Spirit do but paſs by and drop in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion into the heart, he may be known in it; much more when he dwells and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes there.<note place="margin">Cul. White-ſtone.</note> The eloquent <hi>Culverwell</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him to the Sun; <hi>The Sun</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by its glorious Beams does Paraphraſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon its own glittering Eſſence; and the Spirit Diſplays himſelf to the Soul, and gives a full Manifeſtation of his Preſence: And a man may ſooner take a Glow-worm for the Sun, than an experienced Chriſtian can take a falſe Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Light of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have heard the two Witneſſes, the Holy Spirit by an application of Promiſes and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Graces witneſſing to the Conſcience, and the Conſcience ecchoing and reſounding that Teſtimony to the Believer. And hence it appears, That he may be aſſured of the truth of his Graces, and ſo of his Pardon.</p>
               <p>It remains to treat of the ſecond thing,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63874:223"/>that is, <hi>That he may be aſſured of his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in Grace, and ſo of his Salvation.</hi> He knows, That his Graces are true, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, That they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>things having or containing Salvation.</hi> Heaven buds, and Eternal Life begins in them, <hi>He that believeth hath everlaſting life, Joh.</hi> 5.24. He hath it in the firſt-fruits and irrevocable earneſt of it. The Seed of God in him, will grow up into Immortality; the Well of living Water will ſpring up into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life. Only it may be alledged, That theſe Graces may be loſt: Unto which I anſwer, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractively &amp; in their meer creature-eſſence they may; but in their dependance they cannot. Their Standing, if on mans Will only, might fail; but their Foundation on the Covenant of Grace cannot. The Believer may not only ſee his own Graces, but beyond them, that Eternal Election which is the great Fountain thereof. Reflecting on the true Graces in his heart, he may ſay, Here is <hi>the Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> and, Here is <hi>the Love and Patience of Gods Elect.</hi> Spiritual Bleſſings are given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Election, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.4; and I have thoſe Bleſſings in me. Effectual Vocation hangs on Predeſtination, as the higheſt Link in the Chain of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30; and I am ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This made St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epſt. 10.7.</note> ſpeaking of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Vocation, ſay, <hi>Ad ortum ſolis juſtitiae Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum abſconditum à ſeculis de praedeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis beatificandis emergere quodammodo incipit ex abyſſo aeternitatis; When the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63874:223"/>riſes upon the Heart in an effectual Call, the ſecret myſtery of Praedeſtination hid from Ages, breaks forth out of the abyſſe of Eternity.</hi> Here the Great Counſel of Eternal Love, which lay in Gods Boſom, ſhews forth it ſelf to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever through the Lattice of his Graces. Hence he may conclude on good grounds, That his Graces ſhall never fail, ſo long as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God ſtandeth ſure in Election. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſupplies of Grace from the Fountain will keep his Lamp from going out. Its obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that when God expreſſes his freſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to his People, he doth it thus; <hi>I will yet chuſe Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 14.1. Election is from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but it buds and bloſſoms in time in freſh ſupplies of Grace; as if he choſe them again: When the Saints are droo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, and as it were dying away; Election will give another viſit, and make them live a ſecond time. So unſpeakable are the comforts of this Point, that, as I have read, one under the ſweet ſenſe of Electing Love, was for ſome days taken off from all the joys of Nature; and in an holy extaſie cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Laudetur Dominus, Laudetur Dominus,</hi> as if he had been in Heaven already, bearing a part in the Church Triumphant.</p>
               <p>Again, The Believer looks not to his Graces only, but to the <hi>indwelling Spirit.</hi> Faith, and Love, and Obedience cannot fail in his Heart, whilſt the Spirit of Grace is there; and there it will always be, becauſe it is an <hi>abiding <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> perpetually chearing every grace, and <hi>a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinua
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:63874:224"/>irrigatio coeleſtem in illis aeternitatem fovet,</hi> ſaith a judicious Divine on the place, <hi>a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual irrigation cheriſhes an heavenly eternity in them.</hi> Upon this account the Spirit is called the <hi>earneſt of our Inheritance,</hi> not for a time, but <hi>until the redemption of the Church be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Eph.</hi> 1.14; that is, till the whole Sum be paid in Glory. The Earneſt going along with the Believer to Heaven, his Graces cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fail by the way. Our Saviour told his Diſciples, and in them all Believers, That <hi>the Spirit ſhould abide with them for ever, Joh.</hi> 14.16. And two things will make it good to them, I mean, their Union with him, and his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them. Their Union with him will do it, they being myſtical parts and pieces of him; the Holy Fourt will enliven them and their Graces; <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. The Members can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye, as long as there is life in the Head. But may not the Union ceaſe? No, by no means; <hi>God himſelf hath eſtabliſhed it;</hi> thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Now he which ſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath alſo ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21, 22. Believers are eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, and to aſſure them of it the holy Spirit is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a Seal and an Earneſt in their Hearts. This eſtabliſhment of Believers ſeems to me exemplified in Chriſts Humane Nature, that once aſſumed into the Word by an <hi>Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was never ſeparated from it, &amp; thoſe
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:63874:224"/>once taken into Chriſt by a <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> are never parted from him; the Apoſtle hints both to us, <hi>The God of Peace who brought again from the dead the Lord Jeſus, make you perfect,</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21. That God who would loſe nothing of Chriſts Humane Nature; no, not in the grave, will perfect Believers as Myſtical parts of him, never ſuffering their Graces to ſee corruption in an utter decay, nor leaving their Souls in the hell of final Apoſtacy. Beſides, Chriſts <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> ratifies it; he in his ſolemn Prayer. on Earth, which as <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf grants was the Canon and Pattern of his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven, prays to his Father for all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>That they may be kept from evil,</hi> Joh. 17.15. If they are not kept, Chriſts Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ceaſes or becomes powerleſs: Neither of which can be; Ceaſe it cannot, becauſe <hi>be ever lives to make Interceſſion;</hi> Become powerleſs it cannot, becauſe <hi>he is a Prieſt after the power of an endleſs life;</hi> what he interceeds for ſhall be done. <hi>I will pray the Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, and what follows? <hi>The Comforter ſhall come and abide with you for ever,</hi> Joh. 14.16. As long as Chriſt pleads at the right hand of Power it muſt be ſo. This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that gallant Triumph, <gap reason="foreign">

Moreover, the Believer looks not only to his Graces, but to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in which God is pleaſed to bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they ſhall be kept alive to the end.

In ſuch Promiſes as theſe every way ſecuring the Believers ſtate of Grace, the Covenant of Grace lifts up it ſelf in a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency above that of Works, which had no Promiſe of Perſeverance annexed to it. Shall we now ſay, That all theſe Promiſes are Conditional, if we will perſevere, and not otherwiſe? Is not this to turn the Covenant of Grace into that of Works, and a ſure ſtate in Chriſt into a lubricous <hi>Adamical</hi> one? Is it not to evacuate all thoſe glorious and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Promiſes touching Perſeverance, as if God in them ſpoke only in ſuch cold Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as this, <hi>I will preſerve you from all evils and dangers, only for that greateſt of all, which is in your own hearts and wills. I will not undertake:</hi> or in ſuch contradictory terms as theſe; <hi>if you perſevere, I will make you perſevere;</hi> as if Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance could be the condition of it ſelf? After theſe Promiſes ſo interpreted Believers are but where they were before; before theſe Promiſes it would have been true, that if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers perſevere and continue in Grace, they do ſo; and after them ſo interpreted, What have they more? What do they contribute to Believers, when the main ſtreſs of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is laid on Mans Will, and not on Gods Grace? But this <hi>obiter.</hi> The experienced Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever knows better how to uſe Promiſes, and from them communes with his own Heart; <q>Hath God promiſed Perſeverance, and will
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:63874:226"/>he not do it? is not his Covenant <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> an Everlaſting Covenant, and are not his Mercies ſure Mercies? Can his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fail, or his words of Grace fall to the ground? Shall I truſt him for Pardon and Salvation, and not for Perſeverance? Will he give me Heaven, and ſhall I faint by the way? It cannot be; <hi>He will guide me with his counſel, and then receive me to glory.</hi> Till I come there I ſhall be ſupported by his hand, and ſupplied with his Spirit; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my life.</q> In ſuch ſort may the Believer be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his Perſeverance in Grace, and ſo of his Salvation.</p>
               <p>Again, the Believer may gather his Pardon and Salvation from <hi>that peace and joy which he finds in his own heart.</hi> There is a kind of Peace and Joy ſpringing out of Moral Virtues, which becauſe of their Congruity to Reaſon leave a ſerenity on the Soul where they are lodged: <hi>Mens ſibi conſcia recti</hi> is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a good Conſcience is <hi>murus aheneus,</hi> a <hi>wall of braſs</hi> to the owner. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Res ſevera eſt verum gaudium, True joy is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere proſecution of Virtue. Hierocles</hi> tells us, That the pleaſure of the Virtuous <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>imitates the joy of the gods.</hi> And it was a Point of ancient Philoſophy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Virtue is ſufficient to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> But the Peace and Joy in believing is of an higher nature: Thoſe in the Moraliſt come but from the face of Reaſon ſmiling on
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63874:226"/>the Congruity which is in Moral Virtues to it ſelf; there is nothing of Grace or Chriſt in them: But theſe in the Believer come from the reconciled face of God ſhining upon the Heart in a Mediator. Thoſe in the Moraliſt exceed not their own ſphere of Reaſon; but theſe in the Believer <hi>paſs all underſtanding,</hi> Phil. 4.7. and are <hi>full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. Heaven comes down in them, and puts a pure ſerenity on the Heart: The Believer now dwells in Paradiſe; the light of Gods Countenance ſhining as a clear Sun; Chriſt as a Tree of Life dropping down Pardons and Graces; the holy Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a perpetual ſpring of Virtues and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; the fragrant Promiſes breathing out the odors of Love and Mercy; the ſweet voice of Peace and Joy uttered from Heaven, ecchoing and making melody in Conſcience: Nothing here but green paſtures and ſtill wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and placid Heavens; not a cloud from the Law to darken the light, not an ach in Conſcience to break the reſt, not a ſpot of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted ſin to ſtain the ſerenity. Oh what manner of Peace and Joy is here! A <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> a Pagan Philoſopher <hi>intermeddles not with them.</hi> Theſe are to be found in the Raptures of a <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or in the Conſolations of an <hi>Auſtin</hi> or <hi>Bernard.</hi> In ſuch a ſtate as this, what ſhould the Believer do? May he not break out in the proper <hi>Idiom</hi> of Faith, <hi>My Lord and my God?</hi> May he not ſinely conclude, <hi>My ſins are forgiven me?</hi> Nay, Ought he not to do ſo, and with <hi>David, call upon all that is within him,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63874:227"/>to bleſs the Lord for it?</hi> After ſuch hanſels of Heaven and Glory, ſhould he yet doubt and ſay, I cannot enter, when he is there already in the beginnings and firſt-fruits thereof? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more unreaſonable. He knows in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the Graces and Comforts in his own heart, That he hath a part in Heaven and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, <hi>The Nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are Seals of the Covenant, evinces this Truth.</hi> In the Goſpel we have Gods Hand, but in the Sacraments his Seal alſo. In the Goſpel, Pardon and Salvation are ſet forth in general Promiſes; but in the Sacraments, they are Sealed up to this and that man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Circumciſion is called, <hi>The Seal of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 4.11; and by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, <hi>The Seal of the holy God:</hi> And Baptiſm, which ſucceeds, and as Evangelical tranſcends it, muſt be as much and more. So Sealing Pardon and Salvation to Believers, that there follows <hi>the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21; or ſuch a Conſcience, as can with an holy conſidence interrogate God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome ſuch terms as theſe; Did not Chriſt purchaſe Pardon and Salvation for me? Have I not a ſhare and intereſt in them? Yes aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no doubt of it. The <hi>Paſsover</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out Chriſt the true Lamb, who was reaſted in the Fire of his Fathers Wrath to take away Sin; and the ſprinkling of the Blood on the Door-poſts, pointed out the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts Blood to the Conſciences of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63874:227"/>in particular. The <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which roſe out of the Aſhes of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Supper, and took its very Materials from thence, doth eminently Seal Chriſt with all his Benefits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Believer. Our Saviour delivering it to his Diſciples, ſaid, <hi>This is my body which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for you; this is my blood which is ſhed for you, Luk.</hi> 22.19, 20. Why <hi>for you,</hi> but to ſignifie the particular Application of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them? By the Elements of Bread and Wine, as by turf and twig, God gives the Believer livery and ſeiſin of Chriſt; as if he ſaid to him expreſly, Chriſt is thing, Pardon and Salvation are thine, thou haſt my Seal for it, and mayſt be as ſure of it, as of the Bread and Wine in thine Hand and Mouth. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſes,<note place="margin">De effect. Sacram. l. 1. c. 8.</note> That Sacraments were inſtituted, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nos certos reddant remiſſionis &amp; gratie, To make us certain of Pardon and Grace.</hi> Only he adds, <hi>'Tis only a moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not an infallible one.</hi> But how frivolous is this? What can make an Infallible certainty, if Gods Seal cannot do it? Among all Nations Seals are great Confirmatives. When <hi>Darius,</hi> but a man, Signed the Decree, though of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, it was unalterable <hi>by the Law of the Medes and Perſians, Dan.</hi> 6.12. And what the Great God Seals in the Sacrament, in a way of Grace and Mercy, muſt much more be ſo, <hi>by the Law of his own Truth and Faithfulneſs.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> looking on the Rainbow, bleſs God who remembers his Covenant, and is faithful in his Promiſes, as being ſure that the World
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63874:228"/>ſhall not be drowned again: Much more may the Believer, looking on the Bread and Wine, do ſo, as ſure of Pardon and Salvation in and through Chriſt. But you will ſay, Gods Seal indeed is ſure, but our Diſpoſition is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and how can we know that we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receivers? I anſwer, Very well; The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs required, is not that of <hi>condignity,</hi> but that of <hi>congruity.</hi> The leaſt Grace, if true, though but a <hi>bruiſed reed</hi> and <hi>ſmoaking flax,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a capacity. May we not know, That we truly hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, when we inwardly feel a pinching and preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of him, equal to, or rather more than any want in Nature? May we not find, That our Faith in God is right, when it aſſimilates us to his Holineſs, as well as reſts in his Grace, and puts forth <hi>Obedience to his Commands,</hi> as well as <hi>Affiance towards his Promiſes?</hi> May we not ſay, That we love him indeed, when the main ſtream of our hearts runs towards him, when at leaſt in endeavour we obey him in every Command, ſeek him in every Ordinance, glorifie him in every Condition, and prize him in every Saint? Hath he not bid us welcom to the Sacrament? Hath he not anointed us with freſh Oyl of Grace and Joy whilſt we have ſat at his Table? Have we not been clothed with Power againſt our Corruptions? Have not our Hearts been enlarged and refreſhed from the Preſence of God there? How many melting and raviſhing Proſpects of a Crucified Chriſt have we there enjoyed? And what beams of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63874:228"/>Heaven and Eternity have broke in upon us in the very Duty? Theſe things to Believers, who have the exerciſe of their ſpiritual Senſes, are ſo obvious, that they may eaſily and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, That God hath indeed welcomed them to his Table, and there Sealed Pardon and Salvation to them. In this rich eſtate a Believer may bid all Scruples be gone, and in an holy manner ſay to his Soul, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, thou haſt much goods laid up for eternity.</hi> Thou art now ſecure of Pardon and Salvation. The Holy Spirit hath Sealed them to thy Heart, and the Sacraments to thy very Senſe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience witneſſes to both as True and Infallible, and what can be more? Nothing remains, but to <hi>keep thy ſelf in the Love of God,</hi> till he take thee up to the pure bliſs above.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Ways in which the Aſſurance of Faith is attained. With the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus much touching the firſt thing, That <hi>Aſſurance is attainable:</hi> I now proceed to the other, <hi>viz. The ways in which it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi> All which are as ſo many further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove it attainable. Were it not ſo, the All-wiſe God would not ſet down ways for the attaining thereof. Impoſſibles are not to be ſought after. Aſſurance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficult, is not impoſſible: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath chalked out a Method how to arrive at it; which I ſhall endeavour to open in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place: <hi>He who would attain Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, muſt give Grace and Chriſt their due.</hi> All ſpiritual Bleſſings grow upon Grace as an eternal Root, and hang upon Chriſt as the Tree of Life. In particular, Aſſurance is a Bleſſing proper to the Covenant of Grace. In the Covenant of Works there was no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Perſeverance, becauſe the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery was left to Mans Will: But in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace theſe are to be found in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe God undertakes the work. This is the rather to be marked, becauſe man under the Covenant of Works was in a ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63874:229"/>and perfect Holineſs, and under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is in a ſtate of Weakneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; and yet there through Faith he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at Aſſurance and Perſeverance, which were never reached under the Firſt Covenant. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>10th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> notably diſtinguiſhes between the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law</hi> and the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith:</hi> The <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> is, That <hi>the man which doth thoſe things ſhall live in them;</hi> No Life or Peace, but upon perfect Obedience, which is impoſſible, and beyond the line of man lapſed, nay, of man regenerate in this life. Hence the Conſcience of thoſe, who would enter into Peace at this Door, muſt needs be dubious, and full of trembling anxieties. But the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven?</hi> Doubt not, whether thou ſhalt have a part there; this is to bring Chriſt down from above: He is gone to Heaven, and hath carried his Merits thither to prepare a place for thee there. Such a doubt denies his Aſcenſion, and ſo, as it were, brings him down again: <hi>Neither ſay in thine heart, Who ſhall deſcend into the deep?</hi> Doubt not, as if thou ſhouldſt be turned into Hell; this is to bring up Chriſt again from the dead: He is already riſen, and hath triumphed over Death and Hell. Such a doubt denies his Death and Reſurrection; and doth as it were bring him again from the dead. But what ſaith the Righteouſneſs of Faith? <hi>The Word,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63874:230"/>of Pardon and Salvation <hi>is nigh thee,</hi> O Believer, <hi>in thy mouth and in thy heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and believing on the Lord Jeſus thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> Thou in particular, thy Soul ſhall dwell at eaſe, thy Conſcience ſhall enter into reſt in the Covenant of Grace; To doubt of it, is to deny the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt: He therefore, who would have Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, muſt give Grace and Chriſt their due. One would think that the Papiſts, who hold, That they may by perfect Obedience reach the <hi>apex</hi> of the Law, and go beyond it in works of Supererogaton, and climb Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf by their own Merits, might arrive at Aſſurance much rather than Proteſtants, who inſtead of exceeding the Law confeſs themſelves much ſhort of it; and inſtead of meriting Heaven acknowledg all their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes to be but a filthy rag: But it is far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the Papiſts generally do not ſo much as doctrinally hold it, ſave here and there a man among them; ſuch <hi>as Antonius Marina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who in <hi>the Council of Trent</hi> aſſerted it; concluding his Speech thus; <hi>Si Coelum ruat, ſi Terra evaneſcat, ſi orbis illabatur praeceps, ego in Deum erectus ero;</hi> Much-like the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> who in an univerſal languiſhment of nature would yet <hi>rejoice in the Lord the God of his Salvation:</hi> much leſs do they practically arrive at it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf after his fair life, died not like a <hi>Bolton</hi> or a <hi>Rivet,</hi> not knowing whether he had a true Virtue in him or no, but ſeeming afraid of the Judgment-Seat;
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63874:230"/>unto ſome who begged his Prayers when in Heaven he made this Anſwer, <hi>The way thither is not ſo eaſie, I ſhould eſteem it a great Bleſſing from God, if I might obtain Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for many years.</hi> Into ſuch labyrinths do their Principles lead them: The Reaſon whereof is; They eſpouſe <hi>Hagar</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and that <hi>gendreth to bondage</hi> and ſervile fear: They corrupt the great Fountain of Peace and Joy; I mean <hi>free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Chriſt and Grace;</hi> and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts cannot run pure. They would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound thoſe two incompatibles of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> and patch together Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and their own; which in the Apoſtle is <hi>to fall from Grace and make Chriſt of none effect, Gal.</hi> 5.4. And what Peace can follow? Whilſt they look at the Law, Conſcience will be ſtill murmuring, <hi>Non recte ſacrificaſti, non recte oraſti,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> hath it; This and that was omitted or not well done; The <hi>Levite</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> paſs by their Wounds, the <hi>good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> will not come, but alone, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a co-partner, to make a Cure. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wouldſt have Aſſurance, thou muſt build on the right Foundation, and lie at the true Fountain of Comfort: Thy Love and thy Obedience are but Evidences, Chriſt and Grace are the only Foundation: Thy Faith is but a receiver, an empty veſſel; Chriſt and Grace are the Fountain of Comfort: Expect no reſt but in his bleeding Wounds; look for no comfortable words but from the Mercy-Seat:
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:63874:231"/>Think not that thy Conſcience ſhall be appeaſed, unleſs by that Blood of Atonement which appeaſed God himſelf; or that thy heart may be ſatisfied in a Righteouſneſs leſs than that perfect one which ſatisfied Gods: Conſcience is his Deputy, and cannot go off at lower terms than he himſelf doth: Fix thy heart on Chriſt and Grace, lay the whole ſtreſs of thy Soul and Salvation there; <hi>Lean on thy Beloved,</hi> appropriate his Merits and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to thy ſelf. Thus <hi>Luther</hi> tells the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing Law, <hi>O Lex! Immergo Conſcientiam meam in Vulnera, Sanguinem, Mortem, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectionem &amp; Victoriam Chriſti, praeter hunc nibil plane videre &amp; audire volo; O Law! I drown my Conſcience in the Wounds, Blood, Death, Reſurrection and Victory of Chriſt; beſides him will I ſee and hear nothing;</hi> This is the true way of Peace. <hi>Jahannes a Berg</hi> a zealous Papiſt in his life, found it ſo at laſt by his own experience. When a Proteſtant-Friend ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed him then lying on his ſick-bed, That now he would by Faith apprehend the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Saviour, and acquieſce in the full Expiation by him made for ſin, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſwallowed it as the richeſt Comfort in the World, looking on thoſe in Popery but as ſo many vain Fig-leaves. When Aſſurance, which is the top-ſtone of Faith is laid in our hearts, we have reaſon to cry out, <hi>Grace, Grace, Chriſt, Chriſt;</hi> Theſe, whatever our Duties and Works have been, are the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Reaſon of all Peace and Comfort.</p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:63874:231"/>
               <p>Again, <hi>He who would have Aſſurance, muſt not grieve or quench the Holy Spirit, but cheriſh and follow it.</hi> It cannot but be a great and marvelous thing in his eyes, that the holy Spirit ſhould make his heart a Temple or Sanctuary for himſelf. To grieve it is unnatural, and to grieve it expecting comfort a contradiction. If thou wouldſt be aſſured, grieve it in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, indulg not any luſt: This is <hi>filthineſs</hi> and to be carried out of the Sanctuary; this is an <hi>Idol</hi> and muſt not ſtand in the Temple: Bury thy excrements, thy ſuperfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, that the holy one may walk in the midſt of thee; Take away the <hi>accurſed thing,</hi> leſt his Preſence depart: Away with <hi>thy vomits,</hi> thy ſenſual ſins, leſt he complain that there is no place for him left in thy heart. Pride not thy ſelf in gifts or graces, this is as <hi>a ſmoak in his noſe</hi> to force him away from thee; <hi>grieve not him, whereby thou mayſt be ſealed to the day of Redemption;</hi> He comes to ſeal Pardon, and Peace, and Heaven it ſelf to thy Soul, why ſhouldſt thou grieve him? If thou doſt ſo, How canſt thou expect to be ſealed by him? Inſtead of Sealing, he will turn to be thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, as he did to thoſe Rebels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. He will meet thee in ſome ſtraits of Providence, and by one threatning or other, as by a drawn Sword, ſtop thee in thy perverſe way. Oh! do not grieve him, gather out of thy heart and life every thing that offends, and <hi>his Kingdom of Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy</hi> ſhall be in thee. When an holy Truth appears to thee,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63874:232"/>ſmother it not for a World; it comes from the pure Spirit to light thee to Heaven: Walk in the Light of it; Who knows but that, whilſt thou art in the way, the Spirit may drop ſome heavenly Cordials upon thy Heart? Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the true Road to Comfort. Excellent is that in the Prophet, <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord, his going is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the morning, and he ſhall come to us as the rain, Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. Follow him in his Truths and thou ſhalt know him in his Comforts. Gods Face ſhall be as an <hi>aurora</hi> or morning lighter and lighter on thy Soul; and his Spirit as the dew or rain diſtilling Divine Conſolations on it. Believe it, every ray of Truth, if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, leads to the Joy unſpeakable. When an holy Motion comes, remember who is the Speaker: That Spirit, who can ſeal the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and print Gods Love on the Heart, now calls thee to one Duty or other; <hi>Hear and thy Soul ſhall live;</hi> open thy Sails, and the Gales will blow thee to the fair Haven of reſt. I may ſay of the Spirits Motion, as he in the Prophet doth of the Wine in the Cluſter; <hi>Deſtroy it not, for a Bleſſing;</hi> nay, the greateſt of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; <hi>a Paraclete, a Divine Comforter is in it;</hi> Follow on, and thou ſhalt come to the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Wine-cellar of pure Conſolations, ſuch as Earth aſſords not. The Holy Spirit can witneſs to thy Graces, and ſeal up Gods favour to thee, and be to thee an earneſt of Heaven and eternal Life. As thou wouldſt be aſſured, welcome every motion, cloſe with
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:63874:232"/>every dictate, cheriſh every illapſe of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Monitor; let every inſpiration find thee as the Seal doth the Wax, and the ſpark the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; let thy Soul follow hard after him, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him <hi>E veſtigio, ſtep by ſtep,</hi> as near and cloſe as thou canſt poſſibly. This is the true <hi>way</hi> to reſt.</p>
               <p>Again, if thou wouldeſt have Aſſurance, <hi>firſt make Conſcience pure, and then walk after it:</hi> That Pardon and Salvation, which is founded in Chriſts Blood, and ſealed by his Spirit, muſt be recorded and reported in Conſcience, or elſe there can be no Aſſurance; <hi>If our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows what his Deputy doth in us; I ſay, <hi>make thy Conſcience pure.</hi> Two things chieſly impure it; Ignorance is as a cloud upon it, and Guilt as a wound in it. Make it as lightſome as thou canſt from Scripture, that as a pure glaſs it may be fit to reflect the Goſpel-Comforts on thy Soul. Get a through cure of thy old Wounds, or elſe ſooner or later it will cry out againſt thee: <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtarted up in his Brethrens mind a good while after their unnatural ſale of him. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> roſe again in <hi>Herods</hi> Conſcience upon the fame of Chriſts Miracles. <hi>Theodorick</hi> having cruelly murdred <hi>Boethius</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> was affrighted at the great head of a Fiſh at his own Table, as if it had been one of theirs whom he unjuſtly put to death. Apply therefore Chriſts Blood by Faith, that thy Wounds may be healed. <hi>David</hi> after his
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63874:233"/>great fall, prays <hi>firſt to be purged with hyſop,</hi> and <hi>then for the joy of Gods ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 51. The Hyſop which was uſed to ſprinkle the Blood under the Law, figured out the office of Faith in ſprinkling Chriſts Blood on the Conſcience; that's a ſoveraign Balm to heal thy Wounds, and able to make Conſcience give thee an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Peace.</p>
               <p>I have read a notable ſtory of a ſick Man, who when Satan appeared and ſhewed him a long ſcrole of his Sins in writing, ſaying, Behold thy Virtues; replied, True, Satan, but thou haſt not ſet down all, ſet down alſo, <hi>The Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Such a purifier is this, that a Man may be able, as is ſaid of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to think of his former Evils without fear, as having no ſpot of unpardoned Sin in him; <hi>Thy Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made pure, walk after it.

God warns thee againſt it by thy ſelf; Conſcience will meaſure out Comforts or Terrors to thee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as thou behaveſt thy ſelf well or ill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. If like <hi>Saul</hi> thou force thy ſelf, and rebel againſt light, and give ſtabs to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what haſt thou to do with Peace?

Self-examination is a root which bears Self-knowledg, and at the top of it grows Aſſurance, which is the knowledg of gracious ſelf. Awake therefore, O Believer, down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy own Heart, rifle the labyrinths, and break open the falſe bottoms there; ſee what of Sin is in thee: Is there any darling Sin, ſuch as cogs with thy complexion, or falls in with thy calling, or any way ſteals away thy Heart and Affections from God?

In point of Comfort talents not uſed are as none, Comforts lie dead in Believers as their Graces do; the holy ſire raked up affords no

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63874:236"/>and from one threatning or other will flaſh Hell in thy face: Satan will rake in thy old wounds of Guilt, and put thee into freſh torments; the holy Spirit will be gone, and carry away all his Cordials with him; the Promiſes will be as dry Breaſts, and let out never a drop of ſweetneſs to thee; thy Duties will hang the wing, and become dead and ſpiritleſs, and without comfort. In the end thou wilt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally find, That in crooked Paths Peace cannot be found. Awake therefore, O Believer, to the work of Mortification. Look upon ſin, as it is an evil, an only evil, an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh abomination, infinitely more loathſom than the <hi>Dogs Vomit,</hi> or the <hi>Sow's Mire,</hi> or the <hi>menſtruous Cloth,</hi> by which it is ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in Scripture. Arraign it as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Malefactor that ever was. Call in Death, and Hell, and a blaſted World, and groaning Creatures, and the Ruins of Angels, and Souls of Men, and the bloody Paſſion of Chriſt, and the horrible Injuries done to God himſelf, To bear witneſs againſt it: Each of theſe can tell ſad ſtories about it; and all of them cry out, <hi>Crucifie it, Crucifie it, It is worthy to dye.</hi> Paſs therefore thy doom upon it, that it may do to. Strip it of all its veils, and falſe covers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching appearances; pluck off its Golden Profit, and Silken Pleaſures, and Purple of falſe Honour, that it may look as it is in its own ugly nakedneſs, <hi>ſinful, out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Nail it to the Croſs by holy Reſtraints. if it ſtart in a Thought, or creep in at a Senſe,

Pierce it, let out its vital blood, I mean the love and joy and delight of it. Surrender up thy Affections to God and Chriſt, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, that it may give up the ghoſt; bury it out of thy ſight; never give it a look or glance more; converſe no more with it, than thou wouldſt do with the dead; raiſe it not up again into any freſh embraces; no, not ſo much as the picture of it in a ſinful thought or fancy. After this manner mortifie ſin, and above all thy darling only one, which thy Heart hath been tender of, and could wiſh that it were no ſin; ſpare it not, but cauſe it to dye, as a ſure Pledg that all other ſins ſhall do ſo.

The old Token of acceptance was <hi>firing the Sacrifice,</hi> and it is ſtill a pledg of ſucceſs, when there is warmth in Prayer. Ask <hi>in ſincerity,</hi> in a pure intention, not for ſelf-eaſe, not that thou mayſt fare deliciouſly upon the Love of God; but that thy Spirit may be the freer to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that thy Zeal may be more inflamed towards his Glory; <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight;</hi> in ſo praying. thou ſhalt meet the favour of God. It is very remarkable what poſture <hi>Paul</hi> was in, when <hi>Ananias</hi> was ſent to comfort him, <hi>Behold, he prayeth,</hi> ſaith God; go, let him be filled with the Holy Ghoſt. In the beginning of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. <hi>Davids</hi> Faith run very low, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me O Lord for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> ver. 1.

Whileſt thou art opening and pouring out thy Heart to him, Who knows but he may open his Heart and incomparable Love to thee? the holy Spirit may come and tell thee, as the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> did <hi>Daniel</hi> in the ſame poſture, <hi>That thou art greatly beloved, a man of deſires</hi> with God.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place make <hi>uſe of the Lords Supper.</hi> There God makes a Royal feaſt, <hi>a feaſt of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well reſined;</hi> he ſets forth Chriſt crucified, <hi>whoſe fleſh is meat indeed, whoſe blood is drink indeed.</hi> Come, eat his fleſh and drink his blood, that you may live for ever; <hi>Eat and let thy Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it ſelf in fatneſs; drink, yea, drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi> O beloved Soul, or as the Original Text may be read, <hi>Be drunk or happily inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> with the ſweet Love of Chriſt; the ſame crucified Chriſt, which in the Sacrifice on the Croſs ſatisfied Gods heart, at this Sacrament can ſatisfie thine. Never any Feaſt like this, which chears the Heart of God and Man; How will God manifeſt his Love here in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, Kiſſes, and Unctions The <hi>Jews</hi> at their Feaſts uſed many demonſtrations of Love; ſuch as <hi>Salutations,</hi> faying to their Gueſts, Peace be unto thee; <hi>Kiſſes;</hi> from whence afterwards Chriſtians derived their Kiſs of Charity; or as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it, <hi>Oſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Pacis, A Kifs of</hi> Peace; and <hi>Oyl poured
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63874:241"/>out upon the Head,</hi> called therefore <hi>Oleum lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiae, The Oyl of gladneſs:</hi> And cannot God do much more at his Table? Cannot he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute thee, and ſay, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> to thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou truſteſt in him? Cannot he <hi>kiſs thee with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> and cauſe one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or other to drop ſweetneſs into thy heart? Cannot he give thee <hi>the rich anointings</hi> of the holy Spirit, and <hi>ſill thee with all joy and peace in believing?</hi> Let thy <hi>Spikenard,</hi> thy Faith, and Love, and other Graces ſend forth their ſmell, that he may break a Box of Spikenard in thy heart, and fill, and perfume it with the ſweet odours of his Love: Wait upon him in this Ordinance, there he doth by outward and viſible Elements, ſeal Pardon and Salvation to thee; and believe it, he that puts one Seal to thy Senſe, can put another to thy Heart; unto the Seal of Elements, he can add the Seal of the Holy Spirit; with the outward Bread and Wine, thou mayſt have the <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna,</hi> and heavenly refreſhments from Chriſt. Whilſt thou art renewing thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and avouching the Lord to be thy God, he can own thee, and avouch thee to be one of his Children, and this will be more to thee than a World.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>If thou wouldſt be aſſured, walk in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> this is Goſpel-perfection; the Believers Beauty, the ſoundneſs of all his Graces, the deſire and delight of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as being a Beam from his own Truth and Simplicity. In Scripture he ſeldom mentions
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:63874:241"/>an upright man without ſetting ſome mark of Honour upon him. <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> as one familiar with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22; and as the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and after them the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>he pleaſed God;</hi> and how great a Character is this? <hi>Caleb followed God fully,</hi> and he is ſtiled <hi>a man of another Spirit,</hi> ſuch as is above the rate of common Souls. <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>a perfect and upright man,</hi> and God calls him a <hi>none ſuch</hi> in the Earth. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, That the Seventy Souls that went with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> were worth as much as all the Seventy Nations in the World: I am ſure, the upright, the <hi>Iſraelites indeed,</hi> are the Pearls and Excellent ones in the Earth. Now here I recommend three things to thee, <hi>To walk as in Gods preſence, To have an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſpect to his Commands,</hi> and <hi>To carry a pure intention towards his Glory.</hi> All theſe have a great tendency to Aſſurance. <hi>Walk as in Gods Preſence.</hi> Remember, that he is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Thou needeſt not a Viſion, or <hi>Jacobs Ladder;</hi> where-ever thou art, thy Faith can tell thee, that <hi>God is in the place,</hi> and it is too <hi>dreadful</hi> to ſin in. His Preſence beſets thee behind and before, and thou canſt not break away from it; thy ways are all before him, nay thy very heart; He knows the make of it, and ſtands by the inward Frame and ſecret Springs thereof, ſeeing what is a forming there upon the Wheel, and what thoughts are taking their flight from thence. All is <hi>naked</hi> and

Look ſtedfaſtly, conſtantly unto him, that thou mayſt have ſweet Aſpects and Love-glances from him. Thou mayſt have his Favourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whilſt thou liveſt under his Awful one. <hi>The upright ſhall dwell in thy preſence, Pſal.</hi> 140; that is, in thy gracious Preſence. They ſet him before them, and he cauſes his Grace and Love to paſs before them.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Have an univerſal reſpect to his Commands.</hi> It is a vulgar Rule among the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, <q>That men ſhould ſingle out ſome one Command out of the Law, and exerciſe themſelves therein, that God may be their Frſend, and bear with them
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:63874:242"/>other things.</q> But this is to Indent and Article with God upon our own Terms. The Hypocrite, (as one elegantly expreſſes it), <hi>like a globous body, touches the Law in ſome one point,</hi> in ſome particular Command; but the Upright, at leaſt in deſire and endeavour, <hi>lies cloſe and level to all the Will of God.</hi> The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſeemed to be very much for the Firſt Table; but after all their Faſting and Prayer they could <hi>ſwallow down Widows Houſes,</hi> and ſo give the lye to all their Devotions. The Moraliſt ſeems to be as much for the Second Table; but, as fair as his Life is towards Man, he is very unjuſt to God, ſtealing away that heart which is infinitely more due to him, than the juſteſt of Debts can be to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. If thou wouldſt be aſſured, thou muſt have an univerſal reſpect to his Command; do not pick and chuſe among them, but as <hi>David,</hi> be for <gap reason="foreign">

Upon ſincere Obedience a crop of Comfort comes up; and, becauſe by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, much ſurer than that of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which is under Providence only: <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs; his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth behold the upright, Pſal.</hi> 11.7.

                  </gap>, the Three Perſons in the Sacred Trinity do all look with a loving Aſpect upon ſuch an one. Our Saviour hath told us as much, If a man ſincerely keep the holy Words, <hi>The Father and the Son will come to him, and make their abode with him, John</hi> 14.23. And a little after follows a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Holy Spirit as a Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. Walk uprightly, and thou art in a poſture to receive ſweet mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Love from the whole Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place <hi>carry a pure Intention towards Gods Glory.</hi> This is the ſingle eye in the Body of Duties, all our good Works lie in the dark without it: the want of this was as a black line drawn over <hi>Amaziah</hi>'s vertue; <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Jehu</hi> was anointed and appointed by God to deſtroy <hi>Ahabs</hi> Houſe; and yet for want of a pure Intention, was reckoned as a Murderer for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. That which is true Prayer when it comes from Zeal, may be but howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it comes from Luſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. Thoſe Moral Vertues, which are very gloſſie in the Matter, may in the End be no better than ſplendid ſins. The End is the pureſt off-ſpring of a rational Spirit, and a cardinal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in every Action. The Soul conceives all its Thoughts before the End, as <hi>Labans</hi> Ewes did <hi>their young before the Rods.</hi> As the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:63874:243"/>End is earthly or heavenly, ſo is the Man and his Acting. Remember, O Believer, that thou waſt not made a Man or a Saint; Thy Lamp of Reaſon was not ſet up at firſt or new-lighted afterwards by Grace that thou ſhouldſt center on any thing leſs than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or take thy aim lower than his Glory. Set thy heart on that great End; look right on it with a ſingle eye; whether thou eateſt or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or prayeſt, or heareſt, or whatever good work thou art about, carry on the great Deſign, <hi>That God in all may be glorified.</hi> How taking this is with Chriſt, He himſelf hath told us; <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe; thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck,</hi> faith he to his Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. A pure Intention is that <hi>ſingle eye,</hi> and Obedience that <hi>chain of the neck;</hi> which in Believers doth excordiate and raviſh the heart of Chriſt himſelf; And what ſweet returns will he make upon ſuch taking Graces? Their Graces raviſh his Heart, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts will raviſh theirs: Their thoughts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Glory, and Gods are upon their Peace. <hi>With the upright he will ſhew himſelf upright; with the pure he will ſhew himſelf pure.</hi> They are upright in Duties, and he will be upright in Promiſes; They give him pure Intention, and he will give them pure Mercy; ſuch as is the ſealing of his Love upon their Hearts. <hi>The pure in heart ſhall ſee him,</hi> not in the bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making Viſion only, but before in thoſe Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glances,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:63874:244"/>which are the Firſt-fruits of Heaven here below.</p>
               <p>Again, If thou wouldſt be aſſured, <hi>be much in charity and doing good; As the Elect of God put on bowels of Mercy.</hi> Open thy heart to the poor in Pity, and thy hand in Charity; draw out thy Alms, and with them thy Soul; give outward Things, and which is more, thy Self in real compaſſion; Caſt thy Bread upon the Waters, upon the Tears of the Poor, that it may be carried into the Ocean of Eternity, and there found again in a glorious Reward. When an Object of Charity meets thee, Say not, <hi>Go and come again; paſs not by</hi> as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> did, but, as the good <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> immediately <hi>pour in thy Wine and Oyl into the Wounds of thy Brother;</hi> omit no Seaſon of Charity: Now is thy Seed-time, ſcatter thy good Works, <hi>Sow upon Bleſſings,</hi> as the Phraſe is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. Now Chriſts Bank is open, put in thy Money upon holy Uſury, and God himſelf will be thy Pay-Maſter; Be ſtill a-doing of good, that in thy little ſphere thou mayſt reſemble him who doth good in the great ſphere of Nature: His Sun ſhines and Rain falls every-where; Be as like him as thou canſt, ſhining in good Works, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in Charities upon all occaſions. <hi>Give a Portion to ſeven and alſo to eight,</hi> ſaith the Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.2. From this Text the <hi>Jews</hi> ground a Cuſtom to give an Alms to
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:63874:244"/>
                  <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> poor people every day. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, we ſhould be much in Charity: Look on the Poor as Gods <hi>Altars</hi> erected on purpoſe, That upon their Backs and Bellies thou mayſt offer up thy Charity as <hi>an Odour of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God. Be rich in good Works, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, willing to communicate, laying up a good Foundation againſt the time to come.</hi> This is the way to Aſſurance: Works of Mercy and Charity make Faith viſible, and withal put the Believer into a nearer capacity to have the Love of God manifeſted to him. They make Faith viſible; no Aſſurance can be had, unleſs that Query, <hi>Whether we be in the Faith?</hi> be reſolved in the Affirmative: That cannot be done, unleſs Faith become viſible; and more viſible it cannot be than in ſuch good Works; which as the holy Bloſſoms of it prove that there is Life at the root. The Mercy and Charity, which hang upon it, may tell thee, That thou haſt indeed cloſed by Faith with the infinite Love and Grace above, and from thence brought down all thoſe drops and models of Goodneſs which thou ſheddeſt forth in thy Converſation: The Fruit may prove thy ſtanding in Chriſt the true Root of fatneſs and ſweetneſs. The Image of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs limmed and drawn out upon thy Life, ſhews it ſelf to be from the pure Spirit. St. <hi>John</hi> exhorting <hi>the little children</hi> to a real practical Love, adds this as a ſingular Comfort, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>In this Love we know that we are of the Truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. It thou love thy Brother in Deed and in Truth, aſſure thy ſelf, that thou art of the Truth; That the holy <hi>truth</hi> of the Goſpel is mixed with <hi>faith</hi> in thy Heart, and there grows up into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life and likeneſs: Say not, That thy Faith is dead or idle, as long as it can ſhew forth the Coats and Garments, the Alms and good Works which it hath done; theſe ſhew the life and labour of it: Nay further, theſe put thee into a nearer capacity to have the Love of God manifeſted to thee. God in the Prophet commands them <hi>to deal their bread to the hungry, to cover the naked not to hide themſelves from their own fleſh;</hi> and immediately after lets out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſweet Promiſes to them, <hi>Thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall then go before thee,</hi> Iſa. 58.8. that is, thy Graces ſhall viſibly appear to thee.

And which is more, as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, he will dwell in thee, <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. He dwells in the Divine Life, and the Divine Preſence dwells in him: He hath a <hi>Shechinah,</hi> nay, and an <hi>Oracle</hi> in his own boſom. <hi>God will ſpeak peace to his Saints, Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the laſt place, if thou wouldſt be aſſured, <hi>ſet thy heart on God, and Chriſt, and Heaven;</hi> ſtay no longer in the ſtraits of this lower World, take thy flight by Faith and Love into the ſphere of Infinity, where thy Soul may open and dilate it ſelf for ever. Hang no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the drops and little particles of Being, put forth thy Soul might and main into the great ocean of Sweetneſs and Perfection, which is able to fill up thy two vaſt Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mind and Will with its unmeaſurable Truth and Goodneſs. Warm thy Heart no more among the little ſparks of Good here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſoar up upon the wings of Deſire and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Affection to that pure immutable Sun of Love and Goodneſs; one of whoſe golden rays of favour will be more to thee than a World. Thou haſt, O Believer, a Soul twice Heaven-born; once as it is in its own nature an immortal ſpark from above, and again as it bears the impreſs of Heaven in its Graces. And anſwerably thou haſt a double <hi>impetus</hi> after Happineſs; one in the inſtinct of nature thirſting after it, and another in the more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine impulſes of Grace preſſing towards it as its Center. Think not that ſuch a Soul ſhall ever find reſt, till it come back to the firſt point from whence it iſſued, and reſign up it ſelf to its Original in the boſom of God. Inflame thy
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:63874:246"/>Heart with Love to Jeſus Chriſt who is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely, and wholly deſirable. In his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs thou maiſt ſtand and look up to the ſweet reconciled face of God; In his bleeding wounds thou haſt a paſſage into the infinite bowels of Mercy; <hi>through the veil of his fleſh the way is open to the Holy of Holies;</hi> The oyl upon his head can fill thee <hi>with joy unſpeakable and glorious.</hi> Lift up thine eyes, O Believer, to that wonder of wonders, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> from whence come all the admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellings of God in the ſpirits of Men. Set thy Heart upon that Infinite Maſs and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Merit, which paid off all the ſcores to Divine Juſtice, and over and above bought all the Glory of Heaven for poor worms. Raviſh thy Soul in the rich redundancies and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſures of the Spirit upon him, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow and fill ſo many thouſand precious Souls with Grace. Look ſtedfaſtly upon that pure mirrour of Love, Holineſs, Meekneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Obedience, Patience, which is in his fleſh; look till thou ſhine with the ſame image or ſpiritual <hi>Idea</hi> of Grace; look till thou art captivated in raptures and flames of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; count the whole World droſs and dung for him; eſpouſe him in the deareſt and ſweeteſt affections.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>ſet thy heart upon Heaven;</hi> call back thy Affections from this vain World, where they have been ſcattered a-gathering up ſtubble, unto Heaven thy native Country, that thou
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:63874:246"/>maiſt have a pregnant proof in thy ſelf, that thou art born from thence, and a-going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Follow thoſe attractions, which Heaven the great Center of Grace and Holineſs put upon thy Faith and Love to draw thee up to it ſelf. Long to be up in that pure region of Bliſs where God is <hi>All in All:</hi> There are ſinleſs Perfections, and tearleſs Comforts, rivers of Pleaſures, and plenitudes of Joy for ever. Thou maiſt there read all Truths in the Original, and ſatiate thy ſelf at the fountain of Goodneſs. Have thy Converſation above, drive on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant trade there by Prayers and good Works, that thou maiſt have rich returns of Grace and Love from thence. This is the true way to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. A notable inſtance we have in the <hi>Pſalmiſt, O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee; my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land where no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is,</hi> Pſal. 63.1. and what is the iſſue of it? his Soul which had ſo emptied out it ſelf in holy Pantings and Anhelations after God, was ſoon <hi>ſatisfied with the marrow and fatneſs of his love,</hi> ver. 5. No ſooner was the Spouſe ſick of love to Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. but <hi>his left hand is under her head</hi> in Supports, and <hi>his right hand embraces her,</hi> in the ſweet manifeſtations of his Love to her, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. The more Heavenly the Believer is, the ſitter he is for Aſſurance; which ſerves as a leſſer Heaven for him till he come to the great one which is above.</p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:63874:247"/>
               <p>Thus much touching the ſecond thing, the ways in which Aſſurance is attained.</p>
               <p>To conclude all, the Believer having arrived at Aſſurance, which is the higheſt ſtep on this ſide Heaven, may ſit down with joy upon his head, and begin that Song of Free-grace and <hi>the Lamb;</hi> which is ſung above, though in an higher tune, in the Heavenly quire of Angels and glorified Saints for ever and ever. Well may he ſay, Oh! what hath God wrought? what was he, a lump of duſt and ſin, to be brought hither? How did he lie in blood and death, till Grace came by and put in the breath of Spiritual life into him? Was not his Reaſon the lighteſt part in him, veiled and covered over with groſs darkneſs, when the roſie morn and day-ſpring of Grace firſt broke out upon him in Spiritual illuminations? Was not his Will, though a free Principle, faſt ſhut up in Hardneſs and Unbelief, when Grace o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Iron-gate, and made him free to his own Happineſs? What a poor broken Man, and under what innumerable debts was he, when Grace came and paid off all by the Blood of the Covenant? How much of Earth and Hell was upon him before Grace made him a Son, and limmed out the Divine Image upon his Heart? What ſwarms and legions of Luſts kept poſſeſſion in his Heart, when Grace ſet up its ſtandard and drove them out to make room for the holy ſeed there? And after he became a Saint, what an hand had Grace with
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63874:247"/>him to cure his many weakneſſes, and nurſe up his infant-Graces? What a vaſt charge was it at in freſh anointings and ſupplies of the Spirit, to keep the holy lamp and fire from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out? And at laſt, how rich and glorious is Grace towards him, when it carries him up into the mount of Aſſurance, and there ſhews him the great things which it hath done, and will do for him; the true Graces and bloſſoms of Glory in his Heart, and a fair Heaven that lies beyond them, where Crowns and Robes of Happineſs wait for his coming? <q>Oh! Grace! infinite Grace! thou art the Origine of all Graces, and Center of all Praiſes. All the Saints owe their birth and ſafe conduct to Heaven to thee; and to every ſtep of thine, from the firſt beams and drops of Mercy to the Bliſs-making Viſion and rivers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures above, <hi>Hoſannabs</hi> and <hi>Halielujahs</hi> muſt be ſung for ever and ever.</q>
